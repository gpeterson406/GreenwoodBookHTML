<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Preface</h1>
<p>This book is designed primarily for use in a second semester
statistics course although it can also be
useful for researchers needing a quick review or ideas for using R for the
methods discussed in the text. As a text primarily designed for a second
statistics course, it presumes that you have had an introductory statistics
course. There are now many different varieties of introductory statistics from
traditional, formula-based courses (called “consensus” curriculum courses) to
more modern, computational-intensive courses that use randomization ideas to try to
enhance learning of basic statistical methods. We are not going to presume that
you have had a particular “flavor” of introductory statistics or that you had
your introductory statistics out of a particular text, just that you have had a
course that tried to introduce you to the basic terminology and ideas
underpinning statistical reasoning. We would expect that you are familiar with
the logic (or sometimes illogic) of hypothesis testing including null and
alternative hypothesis  and confidence interval  construction and interpretation
and that you have seen all of this in a couple of basic situations. We start
with a review of these ideas in one and two group situations with a
quantitative response, something that you should have seen before.</p>
<p>This text covers a wide array of statistical tools that are connected through situation, methods used,
or both. As we explore various techniques, look for the identifying characteristics
of each method – what type of research questions are being addressed
(relationships or group differences, for example) and what type of variables
are being analyzed (quantitative or categorical). <strong><em>Quantitative variables</em></strong>  are made up of numerical measurements that have meaningful units attached to
them. <strong><em>Categorical variables</em></strong>  take on values that are categories or labels.
Additionally, you will need to carefully identify the <strong><em>response</em></strong>  and <strong><em>explanatory</em></strong>  variables, where
the study and variable characteristics should suggest which variables should be used
as the explanatory variables that may explain
variation in the response variable. Because this is an intermediate statistics
course, we will start to handle more complex situations (many explanatory
variables) and will provide some tools for graphical explorations to complement
the more sophisticated statistical models required to handle these situations.</p>
<div id="section1-1" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Overview of methods</h2>
<p>After you are introduced to basic statistical ideas, a wide array of statistical methods become
available. The methods explored here focus on assessing (estimating and testing
for) relationships between variables, sometimes when controlling for or
modifying relationships based on levels of another variable – which is where statistics gets interesting and really useful. Early statistical analyses (approximately 100 years ago) were
focused on describing a single variable. Your introductory statistics course
should have heavily explored methods for summarizing and doing inference in
situations with one group or where you were comparing results for two groups of
observations. Now, we get to consider more complicated situations – culminating
in a set of tools for working with multiple explanatory variables, some of
which might be categorical and related to having different groups of subjects
that are being compared. Throughout the methods we will cover, it will be
important to retain a focus on how the appropriate statistical analysis depends
on the research question and data collection process as well as the types of
variables measured.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-1">1.1</a> frames the topics we will discuss. Taking a broad
view of the methods we will consider,
there are basically two scenarios – one when the response is quantitative and
one when the response is categorical. Examples of quantitative responses we will
see later involve <em>passing distance of cars for a bicycle rider</em> (in centimeters (cm)) and <em>body fat</em> (percentage).
Examples of categorical variables include <em>improvement</em> (none, some, or marked)
in a clinical trial related to arthritis symptoms or whether a student has turned in copied work
(never, done this on an exam or paper, or both). There are going to be some more
nuanced aspects to all these analyses as the complexity of both sides of Figure
<a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-1">1.1</a> suggest, but note that near the bottom, each tree converges
on a single
procedure, using a <strong><em>linear model</em></strong>  for a quantitative response variable or
using a <strong><em>Chi-square test</em></strong> for a categorical response.  After selecting the
appropriate procedure and completing the necessary technical steps to get results
for a
given data set, the final step involves assessing the scope of inference
 and
types of conclusions that are appropriate based on the design of the study.</p>

</div>
<p>We will be spending most of the semester working on methods for quantitative
response variables (the
left side of Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-1">1.1</a> is covered in Chapters <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>,
<a href="chapter3.html#chapter3">3</a>, <a href="chapter4.html#chapter4">4</a>, <a href="chapter6.html#chapter6">6</a>, <a href="chapter7.html#chapter7">7</a>, and
<a href="chapter8.html#chapter8">8</a>), stepping
over to handle the situation with a categorical response variable in Chapter <a href="chapter5.html#chapter5">5</a> (right side
of Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-1">1.1</a>).
Chapter <a href="chapter9.html#chapter9">9</a> contains case studies
illustrating all the methods discussed previously, providing a final opportunity
to explore additional examples that illustrate how finding a
path through Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-1">1.1</a> can lead to the appropriate analysis.</p>
<p>The first topics (Chapters <a href="chapter1.html#chapter1">1</a>, and <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>) will be more
familiar as we start with single and two group situations
with a quantitative response. In your previous statistics course, you should
have seen methods for estimating and quantifying uncertainty for the mean of a
single group and for differences in the means of two groups. Once we have briefly
reviewed these methods and introduced the statistical software that we will use
throughout the course, we will consider the first new statistical material in
Chapter <a href="chapter3.html#chapter3">3</a>. It involves the situation with a quantitative response
variable where
there are more than 2 groups to compare – this is what we call the <strong><em>One-Way
ANOVA</em></strong> situation. It generalizes the 2-independent sample hypothesis
test to handle situations where more than 2 groups are being studied. When we
learn this method, we will begin discussing model assumptions  and methods for
assessing those assumptions that will be present in every analysis involving a
quantitative response. The <strong><em>Two-Way ANOVA</em></strong> (Chapter <a href="chapter3.html#chapter3">3</a>)
considers situations with two categorical explanatory variables and a
quantitative response. To make
this somewhat concrete, suppose we are interested in assessing differences in,
say, the <em>yield</em> of wheat from a field based on the amount of <em>fertilizer</em> applied
(none, low, or high) and <em>variety</em> of wheat (two types). Here, <em>yield</em> is a quantitative response variable that might be measured in bushels per acre and
there are two categorical explanatory variables, <em>fertilizer</em>, with three levels, and <em>variety</em>, with two levels. In this material, we introduce the idea of an
<strong><em>interaction</em></strong> between the two explanatory variables:  the relationship between one categorical
variable and the mean of the response changes depending on the levels of the
other categorical variable. For example, extra fertilizer might enhance the
growth of one variety and hinder the growth of another so we would say that <em>fertilizer</em> has different impacts based on the level of <em>variety</em>. Given this interaction may or may not actually be present, we will consider two versions of the model in Two-Way ANOVAs,  what are called the <strong><em>additive</em></strong>  (no interaction) and the <strong><em>interaction</em></strong>  models.</p>
<p>Following the methods for two categorical variables and a quantitative response, we explore a method for
analyzing data where the response is categorical, called the <strong><em>Chi-square test</em></strong>
in Chapter <a href="chapter5.html#chapter5">5</a>. This most closely matches the One-Way ANOVA
situation with a single categorical explanatory variable, except now the
response variable is categorical. For example, we will assess whether taking a
drug (vs taking a <strong><em>placebo</em></strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>)
has an <strong><em>effect</em></strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the type of improvement the subjects demonstrate. There
are two different scenarios
for study design that impact the analysis technique and hypotheses tested in
Chapter <a href="chapter5.html#chapter5">5</a>. If the explanatory variable reflects the group that
subjects were
obtained from, either through randomization of the treatment level to the
subjects or by taking samples from separate populations, this is called a
<strong><em>Chi-square Homogeneity Test</em></strong>.  It is also possible to obtain a single sample
from a population and then obtain information on the levels of the explanatory
variable for each
subject. We will analyze these results using what is called a <strong><em>Chi-square Independence Test</em></strong>.
 They both use the same test statistic but we use slightly different graphics and are testing different hypotheses in these two related
situations. Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-1">1.1</a> also shows that if we had a quantitative explanatory
variable and a categorical response that we would need to “bin” or create
categories of responses from the quantitative variable to use the Chi-square
testing methods.</p>
<p>If the predictor and response variables are both quantitative, we start with
scatterplots, correlation,
and <strong><em>simple linear regression</em></strong> models (Chapters <a href="chapter6.html#chapter6">6</a> and
<a href="chapter7.html#chapter7">7</a>) – things you should have seen, at least to some degree,
previously. The biggest differences here will be
the depth of exploration of diagnostics and inferences for this model and
discussions of transformations of variables.  If there is more than one
explanatory variable, then we say that we are doing <strong><em>multiple linear regression</em></strong>
(Chapter <a href="chapter8.html#chapter8">8</a>) – the “multiple” part of the name reflects that there will
be more
than one explanatory variable. We use the same name if we have a mix of
categorical and quantitative predictor variables but there are some new issues
in setting up the models and interpreting the coefficients that we need to
consider. In the situation with one categorical predictor and one quantitative
predictor, we revisit the idea of an interaction.

It allows us to consider situations
where the estimated relationship between a quantitative predictor and the
mean response
varies among different levels of the categorical variable. In Chapter <a href="chapter9.html#chapter9">9</a>, connections among all the methods used for quantitative responses are discussed, showing that they are all just linear models . We also show how the methods discussed can be applied to a suite of new problems with a set of case studies and how that relates to further extensions of the methods.</p>
<p>By the end of Chapter <a href="chapter9.html#chapter9">9</a> you should be able to identify, perform
using the statistical software R <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-base" role="doc-biblioref">R Core Team 2021</a>)</span>, and interpret the results from each of these methods. There
is a lot to learn, but many of the tools for using R and interpreting results
of the analyses accumulate and repeat throughout the textbook. If you work hard to
understand the initial methods, it will help you when the methods get more
complicated. You will likely feel like you are just starting to learn how to
use R at the end of the semester and for learning a new language that is
actually an accomplishment. We will just be taking you on the first steps of a
potentially long journey and it is up to you to decide how much further you
want to go with learning the software.</p>
<p>All the methods you will learn require you to carefully consider how the data were collected, how that
pertains to the population of interest, and how that impacts the inferences
that can be made. The <strong><em>scope of inference</em></strong> from the bottom of Figure
<a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-1">1.1</a> is our shorthand term for remembering to think about two aspects
of the study – <strong><em>random assignment</em></strong> and <strong><em>random sampling</em></strong>.
  In a given
situation, you need to use the description of the study to decide if the
explanatory variable was randomly assigned to study units (this allows for <strong><em>causal inferences</em></strong>  if differences are detected) or not (so no causal statements
are possible). As an example, think about two studies, one where students are
randomly assigned to either get tutoring with their statistics course or not
and another where the students are asked at the end of the semester whether
they sought out tutoring or not. Suppose we compare the final grades in the
course for the two groups (tutoring/not) and find a big difference. In the
first study with random assignment,  we can say the tutoring caused the
differences we observed. In the second, we could only say that the tutoring was
associated with differences but because students self-selected the group they
ended up in, we can’t say that the tutoring caused the differences. The other
aspect of scope of inference concerns random sampling:  If the data were obtained
using a random sampling mechanism, then our inferences can be safely extended
to the population that the sample was taken from. However, if we have a non-random
sample, our inference can only apply to the sample collected. In the previous
example, the difference would be studying a random sample of students from the
population of, say, Introductory Statistics students at a university versus
studying a sample of students that volunteered for the research project, maybe
for extra credit in the class. We could still randomly assign them to
tutoring/not but the non-random sample would only lead to conclusions about
those students that volunteered. The most powerful scope of inference is when there
are randomly assigned levels of explanatory variables with a random sample from
a population – conclusions would be about causal impacts that would happen in the
population.</p>
<p>By the end of this material, you should have some basic R skills and abilities to create basic ANOVA and
regression models, as well as to handle Chi-square testing situations.
Together, this should prepare you for future statistics courses or for other
situations where you are expected to be able to identify an appropriate
analysis, do the calculations and required graphics using the data set, and then effectively
communicate interpretations for the methods discussed here.</p>

<div id="section1-2" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Getting started in R</h2>
<p>You will need to download the statistical software package called R and an enhanced interface to R called
RStudio <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-RStudio" role="doc-biblioref">RStudio Team 2018</a>)</span>. They are open source and free to download and use
(and will always be that way). This means that the skills you learn now can
follow you the rest of your life. R is becoming the primary language of
statistics and is being adopted across academia, government, and businesses to
help manage and learn from the growing volume of data being obtained. Hopefully
you will get a sense of some of the power of R in this book.</p>
<p>The next pages will walk you through the process of getting the software downloaded and provide you with
an initial experience using RStudio to do things that should look familiar
even though the interface will be a new experience. Do not expect to master R
quickly – it takes years (sorry!) even if you know the statistical methods
being used. We will try to keep all your interactions with R code in a similar
code format and that should help you in learning how to use R as we move
through various methods. We will also often provide you with example code. Everyone
that learns R starts with copying other people’s code and then making changes
for specific applications – so expect to go back to examples from the text and focus
on learning how to modify that code to work for your particular data set. Only
really experienced R users “know” functions without having to check other
resources. After we complete this basic introduction, Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> begins doing
more sophisticated things with R, allowing us to compare quantitative responses
from two groups, make some graphical displays, do hypothesis testing  and create
confidence intervals in a couple of different ways.</p>
<p>You will have two<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> downloading activities to complete before you can do anything
more than read this book<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. First, you need to download R. It is the engine that will do all the computing
for us, but you will only interact with it once. Go to <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://cran.rstudio.com</a>
and click on the “<strong>Download R for…</strong>” button that
corresponds to your operating system. On the next page, click on “<strong>base</strong>” and then it will take you
to a screen to download the most current version of R that is compiled for your
operating system, something like “<strong>Download R 4.1.1 for Windows</strong>.” Click on that link and then open
the file you downloaded. You will need to select your preferred language (choose English so your instructor can help you), then hit “<strong>Next</strong>”
until it starts to unpack and install the program (all the base settings will be fine). After you hit “<strong>Finish</strong>” you will not do anything further with R directly.</p>
<p>Second, you need to download RStudio. It is an enhanced interface that will make interacting with
R less frustrating and allow you to directly create reports that include the code and output. To download RStudio, go near the bottom of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a> and select the correct version under
“Installers for Supported Platforms” for your operating system. Download and
then install RStudio using the installer. From this point forward, you should only
open RStudio; it provides your interface with R. Note that both R and RStudio
are updated frequently (up to four times a year) and if you downloaded either
more than a few months previously, you should download the up-to-date versions,
especially if something you are trying to do is not working. Sometimes code
will not work in older versions of R and sometimes old code won’t work in new
versions of R.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:Figure1-2"></span>
<img src="chapter1_files/Fig1-2.png" alt="Initial RStudio layout." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.2: Initial RStudio layout.
</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>To get started, we can complete some basic tasks in R using the RStudio
interface. When you open RStudio, you will see a screen like Figure
<a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-2">1.2</a>. The
added annotation in this and the following screen-grabs is there to help you
get initially oriented to the software interface. R is command-line software –
meaning that in some way or another you have to create code and get it evaluated,
either by entering and execute it at a command prompt or by using the RStudio
interface to run the code that is stored in a file. RStudio makes the management and
execution of that code more efficient than the basic version of R. In RStudio,
the lower left panel is called the “console” window and is where you can type R
code directly into R or where you will see the code you run and (most
importantly!) where the results of your executed commands will show up. The
most basic interaction with R is available once you get the cursor active at
the command prompt “&gt;” by clicking in that panel (look for a blinking
vertical line). The upper left panel is for writing, saving, and running your R
code either in .R script files or .Rmd (markdown) files, discussed below. Once
you have code available in this window, the “Run” button will
execute the code for the line that your cursor is on or for any text that you
have highlighted with your mouse. The “data management” or environment panel is
in the upper right, providing information on what data sets have been loaded.
It also contains the “Import Dataset” button that provides the easiest way for
you to read a data set into R so you can analyze it. The lower right panel
contains information on the “Packages” (additional code we will download and
install to add functionality to R) that are available and is where you will see
plots that you make and requests for “Help” on specific functions.</p>
<p>As a first interaction with R we can use it as a calculator. To do this, click near the command prompt
(<code>&gt;</code>) in the lower left “console” panel, type 3+4, and then hit enter. It
should look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">3</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">4</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="chapter1.html#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="dv">7</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can do more interesting calculations, like finding the mean of the
numbers -3, 5, 7, and 8 by adding them up and dividing by 4:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> (<span class="sc">-</span><span class="dv">3</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">7</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">8</span>)<span class="sc">/</span><span class="dv">4</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="chapter1.html#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="fl">4.25</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the parentheses help R to figure out your desired order of operations. If you drop that grouping, you get
a very different (and wrong!) result:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="sc">-</span><span class="dv">3</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">7</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">8</span><span class="sc">/</span><span class="dv">4</span></span>

<p>We could estimate the standard deviation similarly using the formula you might remember from introductory
statistics, but that will only work in very limited situations. To use the real
power of R this semester, we need to work with data sets that store the
observations for our subjects in <em>variables</em>.
Basically, we need to store observations in named vectors (one dimensional
arrays) that contain a list of the observations. To create a vector containing
the four numbers and assign it to a variable named <em>variable1</em>, we need to
create a vector using the concatenate function
<code>c</code> which means “combine the items” that follow, if they are inside
parentheses and have commas separating the values,
as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="sc">-</span><span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">7</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="chapter1.html#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="sc">-</span><span class="dv">3</span> <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="dv">7</span> <span class="dv">8</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get this vector stored in a variable called <em>variable1</em> we need to
use the assignment operator, <code>&lt;-</code> (read as “is defined to contain”) that assigns
the information on the right into the variable that you are creating on
the left.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> variable1 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="sc">-</span><span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">7</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In R, the assignment operator, <code>&lt;-</code>, is created by typing a
“less than” symbol <code>&lt;</code> followed by a “minus” sign (<code>-</code>)
<strong>without a space between them</strong>. If you
ever want to see what numbers are residing in an object in R, just type
its name and hit <em>enter</em>. You can see how that variable contains the same
information that was initially generated by
<code>c(-3, 5, 7, 8)</code> but is easier to access since we just need the text
for the variable name representing that vector.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> variable1</span>

<p>With the data stored in a variable, we can use functions such as
<code>mean</code> and
<code>sd</code> to find the mean and standard deviation of the observations contained in
<code>variable1</code>:

</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">mean</span>(variable1)</span>

<p>When dealing with real data, we will often have information about more than one
variable. We could enter all observations by hand for each variable but this is
prone to error and onerous for all but the smallest data sets. If you are to
ever utilize the power of statistics in the evolving data-centered world, data
management has to be accomplished in a more sophisticated way. While you can
manage data sets quite effectively in R, it is often easiest to start with your
data set in something like Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice’s Calc. You want to
make sure that observations are in the rows and the names of variables are in
first row of the columns and that there is no “extra stuff” in the spreadsheet. If you have
missing observations, they should be represented with blank cells. The file should
be saved as a “.csv” file (stands for comma-separated values although Excel
calls it “CSV (Comma Delimited)”), which basically strips off some of the junk
that Excel adds to the necessary information in the file. Excel will tell you that
this is a bad idea, but it actually creates a more stable archival format and
one that R can use directly.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The following code to read in the data set relies on an R package called
<code>readr</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-readr" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham and Hester 2020</a>)</span>. Packages in R provide additional functions and data sets that
are not available in the initial download of R or RStudio. To get access to the packages,
first “install” (basically
download) and then “load” the package. To install an R package, go to the <strong>Packages</strong>
tab in the lower right panel of
RStudio. Click on the <strong>Install</strong> button and then type in the name of the package in
the box (here type in <code>readr</code>).

RStudio will try to auto-complete the package name
you are typing which should help you make sure you got it typed correctly. If you are working in a .Rmd file, a highlighted message may show up on the top of the file to suggest packages to install that are not present – look for this to help make sure you have the needed packages installed. This will
be the first of <em>many</em> times that we will mention that R is case sensitive – in
other words, <code>Readr</code> is different from <code>readr</code> in R syntax and this sort of
thing applies to everything you do in R. You should only need to install each R
package once on a given computer. If you ever see a message that R can’t find a
package, make sure it appears in the list in the <strong>Packages</strong> tab. If it
doesn’t, repeat the previous steps to install it.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Important</strong>: R is case sensitive! <code>Readr</code> is not the same as <code>readr</code>!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>After installing the package, we need to load it to make it active in a given work
session. Go to the command prompt and type (or copy and paste) <code>library(readr)</code> or <code>require(readr)</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt; library(readr)</code></pre>
<p>With a data set converted to a CSV file and <code>readr</code> installed and loaded, we need to read the data set into the active workspace.

There are two ways to do this, either using the point-and-click GUI in RStudio (click
the “Import Dataset” button in the upper right “Environment” panel as
indicated in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-2">1.2</a>) or modifying the <code>read_csv</code>
function to find the file of interest. To practice this, you can
download an Excel (.xls) file from
<a href="http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/treadmill.xls" class="uri">http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/treadmill.xls</a>
that contains observations on 31 males that volunteered for a study on methods
for measuring fitness <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Westfall1993" role="doc-biblioref">Westfall and Young 1993</a>)</span>.

<p>The variables contain information on the subject number (<em>Subject</em>), subjects’
maximum treadmill oxygen consumption (<em>TreadMillOx</em>, in ml per kg per minute, also called maximum VO2) and
maximum pulse rate (<em>TreadMillMaxPulse</em>, in beats per minute), time to run 1.5
miles (<em>Run Time</em>, in minutes), maximum pulse
during 1.5 mile run (<em>RunPulse</em>, in beats per minute), resting pulse rate
(<em>RestPulse</em>, beats per minute), Body Weight (<em>BodyWeight</em>, in kg), and <em>Age</em>
(in years). Open the file in Excel or equivalent software and then save it as
a .csv file in a location you can find on your computer. Then go to RStudio
and click on <strong>File</strong>, then <strong>Import Dataset</strong>, then <strong>From Text (readr)…</strong><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>

Click “<strong>Import</strong>” and find your file. R will store the data set as an object with the same name
as the .csv file. You could use another name as well, but it is
often easiest just to keep the data
set name in R related to the original file name. You should see some text appear
in the console (lower left panel) like in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-3">1.3</a>. The text
that is created
will look something like the following – if you had stored the file in a drive
labeled D:, it would be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>treadmill <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;D:/treadmill.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What is put inside the
<code>" "</code> will depend on the location and name of your saved .csv file. A
version of the data set in what looks like a
spreadsheet will appear in the upper left window due to the second line of
code (<code>View(treadmill</code>)).</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:Figure1-3"></span>
<img src="chapter1_files/Fig1-3.png" alt="RStudio with initial data set loaded." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: RStudio with initial data set loaded.
</p>
</div>
<p>Just directly typing (or using) a line of code like this is actually the
other way that we can read in
files. If you choose to use the text-only interface, then you need to tell R
where to look in your computer to find the data file. <code>read_csv</code> is a
function that takes a path as an argument. To use it, specify the path to
your data file, put quotes around it, and put it as the input to
<code>read_csv(...)</code>. For some examples later in the book, you will be able to
copy a command like this from the text and read data sets and other
code directly from the website, assuming you are connected to the
internet.</p>
<p>To verify that you read the data set in correctly, it is always good to check
its contents. We can view the first and last rows in the data set using the
<code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> functions on the data set, which show the following
results for the
<code>treadmill</code> data. Note that you will sometimes need to resize the console
window in RStudio to get all the columns to display
in a single row which can be performed by dragging the gray bars that separate
the panels.

<p>When you load an installed package with <code>library</code>, you may see a warning message about versions of the package and versions of
R – this is <em>usually</em> something you can ignore. Other warning messages could
be more ominous for proceeding but before getting too concerned, there are
couple of basic things to check.

First, double check that the package is
installed (see
previous steps). Second, check for typographical errors in your code –
especially for mis-spellings or unintended capitalization. If you are still
having issues, try repeating the installation process. Then click on the “<strong>Update</strong>” button to check for potentially newer versions of packages. If all that fails, try the cloud version of RStudio discussed before and repeat the steps there.</p>
<p>To help you go from basic to intermediate R usage and especially to help with more
complicated problems, you will want to learn how to manage and save your R code.
The best way to do this is using the upper left panel in RStudio. If you just want to manage code, then you can use what
are called R Scripts, which are files that have a file extension of “.R.” To
start a new “.R” file to store your code, click on <strong>File</strong>, then
<strong>New File</strong>, then <strong>R Script</strong>. This will create a blank page to enter and
edit code – then save the file as something like “MyFileName.R” in your preferred location.
Saving your code will mean that you can return to where you
were working last by simply re-running the saved script file. With code in the
script window, you can place the cursor on a line of code or highlight a chunk
of code and hit the “Run” button<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>
on the upper part of the panel. It will appear
in the console with results just like what you would obtain if you typed it
after the command prompt and hit enter for each line. Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-4">1.4</a>
shows the screen with the code used in this
section in the upper left panel, saved in
a file called “Ch1.R,” with the results of highlighting and executing the first
section of code using the “Run” button.</p>

<p>It provides a suite of enhanced functions to aid our initial explorations. With RStudio running, the <code>mosaic</code> package loaded, a place to write and
save code, and the <code>treadmill</code> data set loaded, we can (finally!) start to
summarize the results of the study. The <code>treadmill</code> object is what R calls a
<strong><em>tibble</em></strong><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and contains columns corresponding to each variable in
the spreadsheet. Every
function in R will involve specifying the variable(s) of interest and how you
want to use them. To access a particular variable (column) in a tibble, you
can use a $ between the name of the tibble and the name of the variable of
interest, generically as <code>tibblename$variablename</code>. You can think of this as <em>tibblename’s variablename</em> where the <em>’s</em> is replaced by the dollar sign. To identify the
<code>RunTime</code> variable here it would be <code>treadmill$RunTime</code>. In the command line it would look like:</p>

<p>And now we know that the average running time for 1.5 miles for the subjects in the study was 10.6 minutes with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.39 minutes. But you should remember that the
mean and SD are only appropriate summaries if the distribution is roughly
<strong><em>symmetric</em></strong> (both sides of the distribution are approximately the same shape and length). The
<code>mosaic</code> package provides a useful function called <code>favstats</code> that provides
the mean and SD as well as the <strong><em>5 number summary</em></strong>: 
the minimum (<code>min</code>), the first quartile (<code>Q1</code>, the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile),
the median (50<sup>th</sup> percentile), the third quartile (<code>Q3</code>, the 75<sup>th</sup>
percentile), and the maximum (<code>max</code>). It also provides the number of
observations (<code>n</code>) which was 31, as noted above, and a count of whether any
missing values were encountered (<code>missing</code>), which was 0 here since all
subjects had measurements available on this variable.

<p>We are starting to get somewhere with understanding that the runners were
somewhat fit with the worst runner covering 1.5 miles in 14 minutes
(the equivalent of a 9.3 minute mile)
and the best running at a 5.4 minute mile pace. The limited variation in the
results suggests that the sample was obtained from a restricted group with
somewhat common characteristics. When you explore the ages and weights of the
subjects in the Practice Problems in Section <a href="chapter1.html#section1-6">1.6</a>, you will get even more
information about how similar all the subjects in this study were. Researchers often publish numerical summaries of this sort of demographic information to help readers understand the subjects that they studied and that their results might apply to.</p>
<p>A graphical display of these results will help us to assess the shape
of the distribution of run times – including considering the potential for the presence of a <strong><em>skew</em></strong> (whether the right or left tail of the distribution
is noticeably more spread out, with left skew meaning that the left tail
is more spread out than the right tail)  and <strong><em>outliers</em></strong> 
(unusual observations). A <strong><em>histogram</em></strong>  is a good place to start.
Histograms display connected bars with counts of observations defining
the height of bars based on a set of bins of values of the quantitative variable.
We will apply the <code>hist</code> function to the <code>RunTime</code> variable, which produces
Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-5">1.5</a>.</p>

<p>You can save this plot by clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> button found above
the plot, followed by <strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong> and clicking on the
<strong>Copy Plot</strong> button. Then if you open your
favorite word-processing program, you should be able to paste it into a
document for writing reports that include the figures. You can see the first
parts of this process in the screen grab in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-6">1.6</a>. You can also directly save the figures as separate files using
<strong>Save as Image</strong> or <strong>Save as PDF</strong> and then insert them into your word
processing documents.</p>
<p>The function <code>hist</code> defaults into providing a histogram on the <strong><em>frequency</em></strong>
(count) scale. In most R functions, there are the default options that will
occur if we don’t make any specific choices but we
can override the default options if we desire. One option we can modify here is
to add labels to the bars to be able to see exactly how many observations fell
into each bar. Specifically, we can turn the <code>labels</code> option “on” by making it true (“T”) by adding <code>labels = T</code> to the previous call to the <code>hist</code> function, separated by a comma. Note that we will use the <code>=</code> sign only for changing options within functions.</p>

</div>
<p>Based on this histogram (Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-8">1.8</a>), it does not appear that there any outliers in the responses
since there are no bars that are separated from the other observations. However,
the distribution does not look symmetric and there might be a skew to the
distribution. Specifically, it appears to be <strong><em>skewed right</em></strong> (the right tail is longer than the left). But histograms can sometimes mask features of
the data set by binning observations and it is hard to find the percentiles
accurately from the plot.</p>
<p>When assessing outliers and skew, the <strong><em>boxplot</em></strong>
(or <em>Box and Whiskers</em> plot) can also be helpful (Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-8">1.8</a>) to describe the
shape of the distribution as it displays the 5-number summary and will also indicate
observations that are “far” above the middle of the observations.

R’s <code>boxplot</code> function uses the standard rule to indicate an observation as a
<strong><em>potential outlier</em></strong> if it falls more than 1.5 times the <strong><em>IQR</em></strong>
(Inter-Quartile Range, calculated as Q3 – Q1) below Q1 or above Q3.

The potential outliers
are plotted with circles and the <em>Whiskers</em> (lines that extend from Q1 and Q3 typically to
the minimum and maximum) are shortened to only go as far as
observations that are within <span class="math inline">\(1.5*\)</span>IQR of the upper and lower quartiles. The <em>box</em>
part of the boxplot is a box that goes from Q1 to Q3 and the median is displayed as a line
somewhere inside the box.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Looking back at the summary statistics above, Q1 = 9.78 and Q3 = 11.27, providing an IQR of:</p>

<p>One observation (the maximum value of 14.03) is indicated as a potential outlier
based on this result by being larger than Q3 <span class="math inline">\(+1.5*\)</span>IQR, which was 13.505:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fl">11.27</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fl">1.5</span><span class="sc">*</span>IQR</span>

<p>The boxplot also shows a slight indication of a right skew (skew towards
larger values) with the distance from the minimum to the median being smaller than the
distance from the median to the maximum. Additionally, the distance from Q1 to
the median is smaller than the distance from the median to Q3. It is modest skew,
but worth noting.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, we will often use extra options to make figures that
are easier for you to understand. There
are often simpler versions of the functions that will suffice but the extra
work to get better labeled figures is often worth it. I guess the point is that
“a picture is worth a thousand words” but in data visualization, that is only
true if the reader can understand what is being displayed. It is also important
to think about the quality of the information that is being displayed,
regardless of how pretty the graphic might be. So maybe it is better to say
“a picture can be worth a thousand words” if it is well-labeled?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> R Markdown</h2>
<p>The previous results were created by running the R code and then copying the
results from either the console or by copying the figure and then pasting the results
into the typesetting program. There is another way
to use RStudio where you can have it compile the results (both output and
figures) directly into a document together with other writing and the code that generated it,
using what is called R Markdown (<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rmarkdown.html" class="uri">http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rmarkdown.html</a>).
It is basically what we used to prepare this book and what you should learn to use to do your work.
From here forward, you will see a
change in formatting of the R code and output as you will no
longer see the command prompt (“&gt;”) with the code. The output will be
flagged by having two “##”’s before it. For example, the summary statistics for
the <em>RunTime</em> variable from <code>favstats</code> function would look like when run using R Markdown:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">favstats</span>(treadmill<span class="sc">$</span>RunTime)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##   min   Q1 median    Q3   max     mean       sd  n missing
##  8.17 9.78  10.47 11.27 14.03 10.58613 1.387414 31       0</code></pre>
<p>Statisticians (and other scientists) are starting to use R Markdown and
similar methods because they provide what is called “Reproducible
research” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gandrud2015" role="doc-biblioref">Gandrud 2015</a>)</span> where all the code and output it produced are
available in a single place. This allows different researchers to run and verify
results (so “reproducible results”) or the original researchers to revisit their
earlier work at a later date and recreate all their results exactly<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. Scientific publications are currently
encouraging researchers to work in this way and may someday require it. The
term <strong><em>reproducible</em></strong>  can also be related to whether
repeated studies (with new, independent data collection stages and analyses)
get the same result (also called <strong><em>replication</em></strong>)  –
further discussion of these terms and the implications for scientific research
are discussed in Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>.</p>
<p>In order to get some practice using R Markdown, create a sample document
in this format using File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown… Choose a title for your
file and select the “Word” option. This will create a new file in the upper left
window where we stored our .R script. Save that file to your computer. Then you
can use the “Knit” button to have RStudio run the code and create a word
document with the results. R Markdown documents contain basically two
components, “code chunks” that contain your code and the rest of the document
where you can write descriptions and interpretations of the results that code
generates. The code chunks can be inserted using the “Insert” button by
selecting the “R” option. Then write your code in between the
<code>```{r}</code> and <code>```</code> lines (it should have grey highlights for those lines
and white for the rest of the portions of the .Rmd document). Once you write
some code inside a code chunk, you can test your code using the triangle on the
upper right side of it to run all the code that resides in that chunk. Keep your
write up outside of these code chunks to avoid code errors and failures to
compile. Once you think your code and writing is done, you can use the “Knit”
button to try to compile the file. As you are learning, you may find this
challenging, so start with trying to review the sample document and knit each
time you get a line of code written so you know which line was responsible for
preventing the knitting from being successful. Also look around for posted
examples of .Rmd files to learn how others have incorporated code with
write-ups. You might even be given a template of homework or projects as .Rmd
files from your instructor. After you do this a couple of times, you will find
that the challenge of working with markdown files is more than matched by the
simplicity of the final product and, at least to researchers, the
reproducibility and documentation of work that this way of working provides.</p>

<div id="section1-5" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Grammar of Graphics</h2>
<p>The previous plots were made using what is called “base R” graphics. It is
possible to make versions of all the graphics we need in this material using
single function calls like <code>boxplot</code> – and there are some places we will
utilize these simple versions because they get us exactly what we want to see.
But to make more complex displays and have complete control of the way the
graphs look, we will utilize the <code>ggplot2</code> package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-ggplot2" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham et al. 2021</a>)</span> which was
built to implement a type of grammar for making and layering graphical displays
of data, adding each layer step by step. 
 While it takes a little bit of work to get
started, the power of these displays will ultimately make the investment
worthwhile<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As opposed to base graphics, the ggplots will contain multiple components
that are patched together with a <code>+</code>, with the general format of
<code>ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;, mapping = aes(&lt;VARIABLE MAPPINGS&gt;)) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()</code>.
Breaking this down, the <code>data = ...</code> tells the <code>ggplot</code> function where to look,
the information inside the <code>aes</code> (or aesthetic) defines which variables in the
data set to use and how to use them (often with <code>x = variable1</code>,
<code>y = variable2</code>, etc., with <code>x = ...</code> for the variable on the x (horizontal)
axis and <code>y = ...</code> for the variable on the y (vertical) axis), and the
<code>+ &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()</code> defines which type of graph to make (there are
<code>geom_histogram</code> and <code>geom_boxplot</code> to make the graphs discussed previously and
many, many more). Because we often have many “+”’s to include, the common
practice is to hit return after the “+” and start the next layer or option on
the following line for better readability. Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-10">1.10</a> shows a
histogram of the <code>RunTime</code> variable made using the <code>+ geom_histogram()</code>.

<p>The warning message reflects a challenge in making histograms that involves how
many bins to use. In <code>geom_histogram</code>, it always uses 30 bins and expects you to
make your own choice, compared to <code>hist</code> that used a different method to try to
make a better automatic choice, but there is no single right answer. So maybe we
should try out other values to get a “smoother” result here, which we can do by
adding the <code>bins = ...</code> to the <code>+ geom_histogram()</code>, such as
<code>+ geom_histogram(bins = 8)</code> to get an 8 bin histogram in
Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-11">1.11</a>.</p>

<p>The following chapters will explore further modifications for these
plots, but there are a couple of additions to highlight. The first is that we
can often layer multiple geoms on the same plot and the order of the additions
defines which layer is “on top,” with the plot built up sequentially. So we can
add a boxplot on top of a histogram by putting it after the histogram layer.
Also in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:Figure1-12">1.12</a>, the <code>geom_rug</code> is also added, which puts
a tick mark for each observation on the lower part of the x-axis. 
Rug plots use a graphical technique called <strong><em>jittering</em></strong> to add a little
noise<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> to each observation so that multiple similar or
tied observations do not plot as a single line.  There are options
to control the color of individual components when we add them (the histogram is
filled with grey (<code>fill = "grey"</code>), the boxplot is in “tomato”
(<code>color = "tomato"</code>), and the rug plot is in “skyblue”). Finally, the last
change here is to the “theme” for the plot<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> which we can include one of a suite of different
layouts with themes such as <code>+ theme_bw()</code> or <code>+ theme_light()</code>. If you add the
<code>ggthemes</code> package<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-ggthemes" role="doc-biblioref">Arnold 2021</a>)</span>, you can access a long list of alternative looks
for your plot (see <a href="https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/index.html" class="uri">https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/index.html</a> for
options there).

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Exiting RStudio</h2>
<p>Finally, when you are done with your work and attempt to exit out of RStudio,
it will ask you to save your workspace. <strong><em>DO NOT DO THIS!</em></strong> It will just
create a cluttered workspace and could even cause you to get incorrect results.</p>
<p>In fact, you should go into the Tools -&gt; Global Options and then make sure that
“Save workspace to .RData on exit” option on the first screen you will see is
set to <strong><em>Never</em></strong>. If you save your R code either as a .R or (better) an R
Markdown (.Rmd) file, you can re-create any results by simply
re-running that code or re-knitting the file. If you find that you have lots of
“stuff” in your workspace because you accidentally saved your workspace, just
run <code>rm(list = ls())</code>. It will delete all the data sets from your workspace.</p>
</div>
<div id="section1-7" class="section level2" number="1.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Chapter summary</h2>
<p>This chapter covered getting R and RStudio downloaded and some basics of working with
R via RStudio. You should be able to read a data set into R and run some basic
functions, all done using the RStudio interface. If you are struggling with
this, you should seek additional help with these technical issues so that you
are ready for more complicated statistical methods that are going to be
encountered in the following chapters. The way everyone learns R is
by starting with some example code that does most of what you want to do and
then you modify it. If you can complete the Practice Problems that follow, you
are well on your way to learning to use R.</p>
<p>The statistical methods in this chapter were minimal and all should have been
review. They involved a quick reminder of summarizing the center, spread, and
shape of distributions using numerical summaries of the mean and SD and/or the
min, Q1, median, Q3, and max and the histogram and boxplot as graphical
summaries. We revisited the ideas of symmetry and skew. But the main point was
really to get a start on using R via RStudio to provide results you should be familiar with
from your previous statistics experience(s) and to introduce some of the code we
will be building on in the next chapters.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Summary of important R code</h2>
<p>To help you learn and use R, there is a section highlighting the most important
R code used near the end of each
chapter. The bold text will never change but the
lighter and/or ALL CAPS text (red in the online or digital version) will need
to be customized to your particular application. The sub-bullet for each
function will discuss the use of the function and pertinent options or packages
required. You can use this as a guide to finding the function names and some
hints about options that will help you to get the code to work. You can also
revisit the worked examples using each of the functions.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Practice problems</h2>
<p>In each chapter, the last section contains some questions for you to complete
to make sure you understood the
material. You can download the code to answer questions 1.1 to 1.5 below at
<a href="http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/Ch1.Rmd" class="uri">http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/Ch1.Rmd</a>. But to practice
learning R, it would be most useful for you to try to accomplish the requested tasks
yourself and then only refer to the provided R code if/when you struggle.
These questions provide a great venue to check your learning, often to see the
methods applied to another data set, and for something to discuss in study groups,
with your instructor, and at the Math Learning Center.</p>
<p>1.1. Open RStudio and go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown… to create a .Rmd.
Click on the “Knit” button and see what happens. Try to complete the following
questions in that document, clicking on the Knit button after you add a code
chunk with code to complete each question. Part of the assignment on this
question is to not get frustrated the first time you are trying this and seek
out help to answer questions you have when practicing.</p>
<p>1.2. Read in the treadmill data set
discussed previously and find the mean and SD of the Ages (<code>Age</code> variable) and Body
Weights (<code>BodyWeight</code> variable). In studies involving human subjects, it is
common to report a
summary of characteristics of the subjects. Why does this matter? Think about
how your interpretation of any study of the fitness of subjects would change if
the mean age (same spread) had been 20 years older or 35 years younger.</p>
<p>1.3. How does knowing about the
distribution of results for <em>Age</em> and <em>BodyWeight</em> help you understand the
results for the Run Times discussed previously?</p>
<p>1.4. The mean and SD are most useful
as summary statistics only if the distribution is relatively symmetric. Make a
histogram of <em>Age</em> responses and
discuss the shape of the distribution (is it skewed right, skewed left,
approximately symmetric?; are there outliers?). Approximately what range of
ages does this study pertain to?</p>
<p>1.5. The weight responses are in
kilograms and you might prefer to see them in pounds. The conversion is
<code>lbs = 2.205*kgs</code>. Create a new variable in the <code>treadmill</code>
tibble called <em>BWlb</em> using this code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="chapter1.html#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>treadmill<span class="sc">$</span>BWlb <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">2.205</span><span class="sc">*</span>treadmill<span class="sc">$</span>BodyWeight</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and find the mean and SD of the new variable (<em>BWlb</em>).</p>
<p>1.6. Make histograms and boxplots of
the original <em>BodyWeight</em> and new <em>BWlb</em> variables, both using base R plots and
using <code>ggplot2</code>. Discuss aspects of the
distributions that changed and those that remained the same with the
transformation from kilograms to pounds. What does this tell you about changing
the units of a variable in terms of its distribution?</p>
