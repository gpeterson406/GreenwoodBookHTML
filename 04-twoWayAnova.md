# Two-Way ANOVA {#chapter4}






## Situation {#section4-1}

In this chapter, we extend the One-Way ANOVA to situations with two factors or categorical explanatory
variables in a method that is generally called the ***Two-Way ANOVA***.
\index{factor} \index{Two-Way ANOVA}
This 
allows researchers to simultaneously study two variables that might
explain variability in the responses and explore whether the impacts of one explanatory 
variable change depending on the level of the other explanatory variable. In some situations, each
observation is so expensive that researchers want to use a single study to
explore two different sets of research questions in the same round of data
collection. For example, a company might want to study factors that affect the
number of defective products per day and are interested in the impacts of two
different types of training programs and three different levels of production
quotas. These methods would allow engineers to compare the training programs, 
production quotas, and see if the training programs "work differently" for
different production quotas. In a clinical trials context, it is well known
that certain factors can change the performance of certain drugs. For example, 
different dosages of a drug might have different benefits or side-effects on
men, versus women or children or even for different age groups in adults. **When the impact of one factor on the response changes depending on the level of another factor**, we say that the two explanatory variables ***interact***.
\index{interaction!Two-Way ANOVA}
It is also possible 
for both factors to be related to differences in the mean responses and not 
interact. For example, suppose there is a difference in the
response variable means between young and old subjects and a difference in the responses among various dosages, 
but the effect of increasing the dosage is the same for both young and old
subjects. This is an example of what is called an ***additive*** type of model. 
In general, the world is more complicated than the single factor models we
considered in Chapter \@ref(chapter3) can account for, especially in 
observational studies, so these models allow us to start to handle more 
realistic situations. 
\index{model!additive}

\indent Consider the following "experiment" where we want to compare the strength of 
different brands of paper towels when they are wet. The response variable 
will be the time to failure in seconds (a continuous response variable) when 
a weight is placed on the towel held at the four corners. We are interested 
in studying the differences between brands and the impact of different amounts 
of water applied to the towels. 

* Predictors (Explanatory Variables): **A**: ``Brand`` (2 brands of interest, 
named *B1* and *B2*) and **B**: Number of ``Drops`` of water (10, 20, 30 drops).

* Response: *Time* to failure (in seconds) of a towel ($y$) with a weight 
sitting in the middle of the towel. 

## Designing a two-way experiment and visualizing results	{#section4-2}

Ideally, we want to randomly assign the levels of each factor so that we can 
attribute causality to any detected effects and to reduce the chances of 
*confounding*, where the differences we think are due to one explanatory variable might be due to another variable that varied with the this explanatory variable of interest. 
\index{confounding}
\index{factor}
Because there are two factors, we would need to design a random 
assignment scheme to select the levels of both variables. For example, we could 
randomly select a brand and then randomly select the number of drops to apply 
from the levels chosen for each measurement. Or we could decide on how many 
observations we want at each combination of the two factors (ideally having 
them all equal so the design is ***balanced***) and then randomize the order 
of applying the different combinations of levels. 
\index{balance}

\indent Why might it be important to randomly apply the brand and number of drops in 
an experiment? There are situations where the order of observations can be 
related to changes in the responses and we want to be able to eliminate 
the order of observations from being related to the levels of the factors -- otherwise the order of observations and levels of the factors would be *confounded*. 
For example, suppose that the area where the experiment is being performed 
becomes wet over time and the later measurements have extra water that gets 
onto the paper towels and they tend to fail more quickly. If all the observations 
for the second brand were done later in the study, then the *order of observations*
impacts could make the second brand look worse. If the order of measurements to be made is 
randomized, then even if there is some drift in the responses over the order 
of observations it should still be possible to see the differences in the 
randomly assigned effects. If the study incorporates repeated measurements on human or animal subjects, randomizing the order of treatments they are exposed to can 
alleviate impacts of them "learning" through the study or changing just due to being studied, something that we 
would not have to worry about with paper towels. 

\indent In observational studies, we do not have the luxury of random assignment, that 
is, we cannot randomly assign levels of the treatment variables to our 
subjects, so we cannot guarantee that the only differences between the groups 
are based on the differences in the explanatory variables.
\index{random assignment} \index{observational study}
As discussed before, because we can't control 
which level of the variables are assigned to the subjects, we cannot make 
causal inferences and have to worry about other variables being the real 
drivers of the results. Although we can never establish causal inference 
with observational studies, we can generalize our results to a larger 
population if we have a representative (ideally random) sample from our population of interest. 

\indent It is also possible that we might have studies where some of the variables are 
randomly assigned and others that are not randomly assignable. The most common 
versions of this are what we sometimes call subject "demographics", such as 
gender, income, race, etc. We might be performing a study where we can randomly 
assign treatments to these subjects but might also want to account for 
differences based on income level, which we can't assign. In these cases, the 
scope of inference gets complicated -- differences seen on randomized variables 
can be causally interpreted but you have to be careful to not say that the 
demographics caused differences. Suppose that a randomly assigned drug dosage 
is found to show positive differences in older adults and negative changes in younger adults. We 
could say that the dosage causes the increases in older adults and decreases in younger ones, but we can't say that age caused the differences in the responses -- it just modified how the drug works and what the drug caused to happen in the responses. 
\index{scope of inference}

\indent Even when we do have random assignment of treatments it is important to think 
about who/what is included in the sample. To get back to the paper towel 
example, we are probably interested in more than the sheets of the rolls 
we have to work with. If we could randomly select the studied paper towels 
from all paper towels made by each brand, our conclusions could be extended 
to those populations. That probably would not be practical, but trying to 
make sure that the towels are representative of all made by each brand by 
checking for defects and maybe picking towels from a few different rolls 
would be a good start to being able to extend inferences beyond the tested 
towels. But if you were doing this study in the factory, it might be possible to randomly sample from the towels produced, at least over the course of a day.

\indent Once random assignment and random sampling is settled, the final aspect of 
study design involves deciding on the number of observations that should be 
made. The short (glib) answer is to take as many as you can afford. With more 
observations comes higher power to detect differences if they exist, which 
is a desired attribute of all studies.
\index{power}
It is also important to make sure that 
you obtain multiple observations at each combination of the treatment levels, 
which are called ***replicates***. \index{replicate} Having replicate measurements allows 
estimation of the mean for each combination of the treatment levels as well 
as estimation and testing for an interaction.
\index{interaction!Two-Way ANOVA}
And we always prefer^[We would not suggest throwing away observations to get balanced designs. Plan in advance to try to have a balanced design but analyze the responses you get.] having 
balanced designs because they provide resistance to violation of some 
assumptions as was discussed in Chapter \@ref(chapter3). A ***balanced design***
in a Two-Way ANOVA setting involves having the same sample size for every
combination of the levels of the two factor variables in the model. 
\index{balance}

\indent With two categorical explanatory variables, there are now five possible 
scenarios for the truth. Different situations are created depending on 
whether there is an interaction between the two variables, 
whether both variables are important but do not interact, or whether either of the
variables matter at all.
\index{interaction!Two-Way ANOVA}
Basically, there are five different possible outcomes
in a randomized Two-Way ANOVA study, listed in order of increasing model
complexity:\index{model!Two-Way ANOVA}

1. Neither A or B has an effect on the responses (nothing causes differences 
in responses). 

2. A has an effect, B does not (only A causes differences in responses). 

3. B has an effect, A does not (only B causes differences in responses). 

4. Both A and B have effects on response but no interaction (A and B both 
cause differences in responses but the impacts are *additive*). 

5. Effect of A on response differs based on the levels of B, the opposite is also true 
(means for levels of response across A are different for different levels of B, or, simply, 
A and B interact in their effect on the response). 

To illustrate these five potential outcomes, we will consider a fake version of
the paper towel example. It ended up being really messy and complicated to
actually perform the experiment as described so these data were simulated. The hope is to use this simple example to illustrate some of the Two-Way ANOVA possibilities. The first step is to understand what has been observed (number
observations at each combination of factors) and look at some summary
statistics across all the "groups". The data set is available via the following link:


```r
library(readr)
pt <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/pt.csv")
pt <- pt %>% mutate(drops = factor(drops),
                    brand = factor(brand)
                    )
```



The data set contains five observations per combination of treatment levels as
provided by the ``tally`` function. To get counts for combinations of the 
variables, use the general formula of ``tally(x1 ~ x2, data = ...)`` -- noting that the order of ``x1`` and ``x2`` doesn't matter here:
\index{\texttt{tally()}}


```r
library(mosaic)
tally(brand ~ drops, data = pt)
```

```
##      drops
## brand 10 20 30
##    B1  5  5  5
##    B2  5  5  5
```

The sample sizes in each of the six treatment level combinations of ``Brand`` 
and ``Drops`` [(*B1*, 10), (*B1*, 20), (*B1*, 30), (*B2*, 10), (*B2*, 20), 
(*B2*, 30)] are $n_{jk} = 5$ for $j^{th}$ level of ``Brand`` ($j = 1, 2$) and 
$k^{th}$ level of ``Drops`` ($k = 1, 2, 3$). The ``tally`` function gives us an $R$ by $C$ 
***contingency table*** with $R = 2$ rows (*B1*, *B2*) and $C = 3$ columns 
(10, 20, and 30).
\index{contingency table}
We'll have more fun with $R$ by $C$
tables in Chapter \@ref(chapter5) -- here it helps us to see the sample size in 
each combination of factor levels. The ``favstats`` function also helps us 
dig into the results for all combinations of factor levels. The notation 
involves putting both factor variables after the "~" with a "``+``" between them. 
In the output, the first row contains summary information for the
5 observations for ``Brand`` *B1* and ``Drops`` amount 10. It also contains the 
sample size in the ``n`` column, although here it rolled into a new set of 
rows with the standard deviations of each combination. 




\small


```r
favstats(responses ~ brand + drops, data = pt)
```

```

\normalsize



\indent The next step is to visually explore the results across the combinations
of the two explanatory variables. The pirate-plot can be extended to handle these 
sorts of two-way situations using a formula that is something like ``y ~ A * B``. 
\index{pirate-plot} The x-axis in the pirate-plot shows two rows of labels based on the two categories and the unique combinations of those categories are directly related to a displayed distribution of responses and mean and confidence interval. For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-1), the ``Brand`` with levels of *B1* and *B2* is the first row of x-axis labels and they are repeated across the three levels of ``Drops``. In reading these plots, look for differences in the means across the levels of the first row variable (``Brand``) for each level of the second row variable (``Drops``) and then focus on whether those differences change across the levels of the second variable -- that is an *interaction* as the differences in differences change. 
Specifically, start with comparing the two brands at each amount of water. 
Do the brands seem different? Certainly for 10 drops of water the two look 
different but not for 30 drops, suggesting a different impact of brands based on the amount of water present. We can also look for combinations of factors 
that produce the highest or lowest responses in this display. It appears that 
the time to failure is highest in the low water drop groups but as the water 
levels increase, the time to failure falls and the differences in the two 
brands seem to decrease. The fake data seem to have relatively similar 
amounts of variability and distribution shapes except for 10 drops and brand B2 -- remembering that there are 
only 5 observations available for describing the shape of responses for each 
combination. These data were simulated using a normal distribution with 
constant variance if that gives you some extra confidence in assessing these 
model assumptions.

</div>

\indent The pirate-plots can handle situations where both variables have more than two 
levels but it can sometimes get a bit cluttered to actually display the data when our analysis is going to focus on means of the responses. The means for each combination 
of levels that you can find in the ``favstats`` output are more usefully used 
in what is called an ***interaction plot***.
\index{interaction plot}
Interaction plots display the mean 
responses (y-axis) versus levels of one predictor variable on the x-axis, 
adding points and separate lines for each level of the other predictor variable. Because 
we don't like any of the available functions in R, we wrote our own function. It is available two ways. The easiest, if it works, is to install and load the `catstats` R package [@R-catstats]. If you are working on a local RStudio installation, the first step involves installing the ``remotes`` [@R-remotes] R package and then loading it -- this will allow you to install ``catstats`` from our github^[Github.com is a version control system used for software development and collaborative work, which we used to allow us to make changes to it and track the modifications. This book is also written using github to allow the same connection for writing and editing it, and one location where the digital version is hosted: https://greenwood-stat.github.io/GreenwoodBookHTML/.] repository (you can type "3" during the installation to avoid updating other packages when you do this step). 

```r
# To install the catstats R package (just the first time!):
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("greenwood-stat/catstats")
```
After that step, you can load ``catstats`` like any other R package, using 
``library(catstats)``. Some users have experienced issues with getting this 
package installed, so you can also download the needed `intplot` and 
`intplotarray` functions^[Copy and include this code in the first code chunk in
any document where you want to use the ``intplot`` or ``inplotarray``
functions.] using: \index{\texttt{intplot()}}


```r
source("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/intplotfunctions_v3.R")
```




\indent The ``intplot`` function allows a formula interface like ``Y ~ X1 * X2`` and provides the means $\pm$ 1 SE (vertical bars) and adds a legend to help make
everything clear. 

(ref:fig4-2) Interaction plot of the paper towel data with ``Drops`` on the x-axis and different lines based on ``Brand``. 


```r
intplot(responses ~ brand * drops, data = pt)
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:Figure4-2)(ref:fig4-2)</p>
</div>

Interaction plots can always be made two different ways by switching the order 
of the variables. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2) contains ``Drops`` on the x-axis 
and Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-3) has ``Brand`` on the x-axis. Typically putting 
the variable with more levels on the x-axis will make interpretation easier, 
but not always. Try both and decide on the one that you like best. \index{interaction plot} \index{\texttt{intplot()}} 

(ref:fig4-3) Interaction plot of paper towel data with ``Brand`` on the x-axis and lines based on ``Drops``.

</div>

The formula in this function builds on our previous notation and now we include
both predictor variables with an "``*``" between them. Using an asterisk between 
explanatory variables is one way of telling R to include an interaction between 
the variables. While the interaction may or may not be present, the interaction 
plot helps us to explore those potential differences. 

\indent There are a variety of aspects of the interaction plots to pay attention to.
\index{interaction plot}
Initially, the question to answer is whether it appears that there is an 
interaction between the predictor variables.
\index{interaction!Two-Way ANOVA}
When there is an interaction, you 
will see ***non-parallel lines*** in the interaction plot.
\index{non-parallel lines}
You want to look from 
left to right in the plot and assess whether the lines connecting the means are close to parallel, 
relative to the amount of variability in the estimated means as represented by the SEs in the bars. If it seems that there is 
clear visual evidence of non-parallel lines, then the interaction is likely 
worth considering (we will use a hypothesis test to formally assess 
this -- see the discussion below). If the lines look to be close to parallel, then 
there probably isn't an interaction between
the variables. Without an interaction present, that means that the differences
in the response across levels of one variable doesn't change based on the levels of the other
variable and vice-versa. This means that we can consider the ***main effects***
of each variable on their own^[We will use "main effects" to refer to the two 
explanatory variables in the additive model even if they are not randomly 
assigned to contrast the terminology with having those variables involved in an interaction term in the model. 
It is the one place in the book where we use "effects" without worrying about the causal connotation of that word.].
\index{main effects}
\index{model!main effects}
Main effects are much like the results we found in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter3) where we can compare
means across levels of a single variable except that there are results for two
variables to extract from the model. With the presence of an interaction, it is
complicated to summarize how each variable is affecting the response variable
because their impacts change depending on the level of the other factor. And
plots like the interaction plot provide us with useful information on the pattern of those changes. 

\indent If the lines are not parallel, then
focus in on comparing the levels of one variable as the other variable changes. 
Remember that the definition of an interaction is that the differences among
levels of one variable depends on the level of the other variable being
considered. "Visually" this means comparing the size of the differences in the
lines from left to right. In Figures \@ref(fig:Figure4-2) and \@ref(fig:Figure4-3),
the effect of amount of water
changes based on the brand being considered. In Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-3), 
the three lines
represent the three water levels. The difference between the brands (left to
right, *B1* to *B2*) is different depending on how much water was present. It
appears that ``Brand`` *B2* lasted longer at the lower water levels but that the 
difference between the two brands dropped as the water levels increased. The 
same story appears in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2). As the
water levels increase (left to right, 10 to 20 to 30 drops), the differences
between the two brands decrease. Of the two versions, Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2)
is probably easier to read here. Sometimes it is nice to see the interaction plot made both ways simultaneously, so you can also use the `intplotarray` function, which provides Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-4). This plot also adds pirate-plots to the off-diagonals so you can explore the main effects of each variable, if that is reasonable.
\index{main effects} \index{\texttt{intplotarray()}} The interaction plots can be used to 
identify the best and worst mean responses for combinations of the treatment 
levels. For example, 10 ``Drops`` and ``Brand`` *B2* lasts longest, on average, and 30 ``Drops`` with ``Brand`` *B1* fails fastest, on average. In any version of the plot here, the lines do not appear to be parallel suggesting that further exploration of the 
interaction appears to be warranted.

\newpage

\indent Before we get to the hypothesis tests
to formally make this assessment (you knew some sort of p-value was coming, right?), 
we can visualize the 5 different scenarios that could characterize the sorts of
results you could observe in a Two-Way ANOVA situation. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-5)
shows 4 of the 5 scenarios. In panel (a), when there are no differences from either
variable (Scenario 1), it provides relatively parallel lines and basically no
differences either across ``Drops`` levels (x-axis) or ``Brand`` (lines). Data such as these would 
likely result in little to no evidence related to a difference in brands, water
levels, or any interaction between them in this data set. 

(ref:fig4-5) Interaction plots of four possible scenarios in the paper towel study.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="04-twoWayAnova_files/figure-html/Figure4-5-1.png" alt="(ref:fig4-5)" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:Figure4-5)(ref:fig4-5)</p>
</div>

\indent Scenario 2 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-5) panel (b))
incorporates differences based on factor A (here that is ``Brand``) but no real 
difference based on the ``Drops`` or any interaction. This results in a clear shift between the lines for the means of the ``Brands`` but little to no changes in the level of those lines across water levels. 
These lines are relatively parallel. We can see that ``Brand`` *B2* is better than 
``Brand`` *B1* but that is all we can show with these sorts of results. 

\indent Scenario 3 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-5) panel (c)) flips the important variable
to B (``Drops``)
and shows decreasing average times as the water levels increase. Again, the 
interaction panels show near parallel-ness in the lines and really just show differences
among the levels of the water. In both Scenarios 2 and 3, we could use a single
variable and drop the other from the model, getting back to a One-Way ANOVA
model, without losing any important information. 

\indent Scenario 4 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-5) panel (d)) incorporates
effects of A and B, but they are ***additive***. That means that the effect
of one variable is the same across the levels of the other variable. In this 
experiment, that would mean that ``Drops`` has the same impact on performance 
regardless of brand and that the brands differ but each type of difference is 
the same regardless of levels of the other variable. 
The interaction plot lines are more or less parallel but now the brands are
clearly different from each other. The plot shows the decrease in performance
based on increasing water levels and that ``Brand`` *B2* is better than 
``Brand`` *B1*. Additive effects show the same difference in lines from left to 
right in the interaction plots. 

\indent Finally, Scenario 5 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-6)) involves
an interaction between the two variables (``Drops`` and ``Brand``). There are many ways
that interactions can present but the main thing is to look for clearly
non-parallel lines.
\index{non-parallel lines}
As noted in the previous discussion, the ``Drops`` effect 
appears to change depending on which level of ``Brand`` is being considered. 
Note that the plot here described as Scenario 5 is the same as the initial plot 
of the results in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2). 

(ref:fig4-6) Interaction plot of Scenario 5 where it appears that an interaction is present.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:Figure4-6)(ref:fig4-6)</p>
</div>

\indent The typical modeling protocol is to start with assuming that Scenario 5 is a possible
description of the results, related to fitting what is called the 
***interaction model***, and then attempt to simplify the model (to the 
***additive model***) if warranted.
\index{model!interaction}
We need a hypothesis test to help decide if 
the interaction is "real". We start with assuming there is no interaction between the two factors in their impacts on the response and assess evidence against that null hypothesis. We need a hypothesis test
because the lines will never be exactly parallel in real data and, just like in the One-Way
ANOVA situation, the amount of variation around the lines impacts the ability
of the model to detect differences, in this case of an interaction. 
\index{interaction!Two-Way ANOVA}

## Two-Way ANOVA models and hypothesis tests	{#section4-3}

To assess interactions with two
variables, we need to fully describe models for the additive and interaction
scenarios and then develop a method for assessing evidence of the need for
different aspects of the models. First, we need to define the notation for
these models:

* $y_{ijk}$ is the $i^{th}$ response from the group for level $j$ of factor A
and level $k$ of factor B

    * $j = 1,\ldots,J$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $J$ is the number of levels of A
    
    * $k = 1,\ldots,K$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $K$ is the number of levels of B
    
    * $i = 1,\ldots,n_{jk}$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $n_{jk}$ is the sample size for level
    $j$ of factor A and level $k$ of factor B
    
    * $N = \Sigma_j\Sigma_k n_{jk}$ is the total sample size (sum of the number of 
    observations across all $JK$ groups)

We need to extend our previous discussion of reference-coded models to develop a
Two-Way ANOVA model. We start with the ***Two-Way ANOVA interaction model***:
\index{model!interaction}

$$y_{ijk} = \alpha + \tau_j + \gamma_k + \omega_{jk} + \varepsilon_{ijk},$$

where $\alpha$ is the baseline group mean (for level 1 of A **and** level 1 of B),
$\tau_j$ is the deviation for the ***main effect*** of A from the baseline
for levels $2,\ldots,J$, $\gamma_k$ (gamma $k$) is the deviation for the main 
effect of B from the baseline for levels $2,\ldots,K$, and $\omega_{jk}$ 
(omega $jk$) is the adjustment for the ***interaction effect*** for level 
$j$ of factor A and level $k$ of factor B for $j = 1,\ldots,J$ and $k = 1,\ldots,K$. In this model, $\tau_1$, $\gamma_1$, and $\omega_{11}$ are all fixed at 0 because $\alpha$ is the mean for the combination of the baseline levels of both variables and so no adjustments are needed. 
Additionally, any $\omega_{jk}$'s that contain the baseline category of either factor A or B are also set to 0 and the model for these levels just involves $\tau_j$ or $\gamma_k$ added to the intercept. Exploring the R output will help clarify which coefficients are present or set to 0 (so not displayed) in these models. As in Chapter \@ref(chapter3), R will typically choose the baseline categories
alphabetically but now it is choosing a baseline for both variables and so our
detective work will be doubled to sort this out. 

\indent If the interaction term is not important, usually based on the interaction test 
presented below, the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$ can be dropped from the model 
and we get a model that corresponds to Scenario 4
above. Scenario 4 is where there are two main effects in the model but no interaction
between them. The ***additive Two-Way model*** is
\index{model!additive}

$$y_{ijk} = \alpha + \tau_j + \gamma_k + \varepsilon_{ijk},$$

where each component is defined as in the interaction model. The difference between
the interaction and additive models is setting all the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$
to 0 that are present in the interaction model. When we set parameters to 0 in
models it removes them from the model. Setting parameters to 0 is also how we will develop
our hypotheses to test for an interaction, by assessing evidence against a null hypothesis that all $\omega_{jk}\text{'s} = 0$.

\indent The interaction test hypotheses are 

* $H_0$: No interaction between A and B on response in population $\Leftrightarrow$ All
$\omega_{jk}\text{'s} = 0$.

* $H_A$: Interaction between A and B on response in population $\Leftrightarrow$ At least
one $\omega_{jk}\ne 0$.

To perform this test, a new ANOVA $F$-test is required (presented below) but 
there are also hypotheses relating to the main effects of A ($\tau_j\text{'s}$)
and B ($\gamma_k\text{'s}$).
\index{@$F$-test}
\index{main effects}
If you decide that there is sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis 
that no interaction is
present to conclude that one is likely present, then it is dangerous to ignore the interaction and test for the main effects
because important main effects can be masked by interactions (examples later). 
It is important to note that, by definition, **both variables matter if an interaction is found to be important** so the main effect tests may not be 
very interesting in an interaction model. If the interaction is found
to be important based on the test and so is retained in the model, you should focus
on the interaction model (also called the ***full model***) in order to 
understand and describe the form of the interaction among the variables.
\index{model!full}
\index{model!interaction}

\indent If the interaction test does not return
a small p-value and you decide that you do not have enough evidence against the null hypothesis to suggest that the interaction is needed, the interaction
can be dropped from the model. In this situation, we would re-fit the model and
focus on the results provided by the additive model -- performing tests for the
two additive main effects. 
\index{model!additive}
For the first, but not last time, we encounter a
model with more than one variable and more than one test of potential interest. In models
with multiple variables at similar levels (here both are main effects), we are
interested in the results for each variable given that the other variable is in
the model. In many situations, including more than one variable in a model
changes the results for the other variable even if those variables do not
interact. The reason for this is more clear in Chapter \@ref(chapter8) and really only
matters here if we have unbalanced designs, but we need to start adding a short
modifier to our discussions of main effects -- they are the results 
*conditional on* or *adjusting for* or, simply, *given*, the other variable(s) 
in the model. Specifically, the hypotheses for the two main effects are: 

* Main effect test for A: \index{main effects}

    * $H_0$: No differences in means across levels of A in population, 
    given B in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\tau_j\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
    * $H_A$: Some difference in means across levels A in population, 
    given B in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ At least one $\tau_j \ne 0$, in additive model. 

* Main effect test for B:

    * $H_0$: No differences in means across levels of B in population, 
    given A in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\gamma_k\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
    * $H_A$: Some difference in means across levels B in population, 
    given A in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ At least one $\gamma_k \ne 0$, in additive model. 
    
\indent In order to test these effects (interaction in the interaction model and 
main effects in the additive model), $F$-tests are developed using Sums of
Squares, Mean Squares, and degrees of freedom similar to those in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter3).
\index{degrees of freedom}
We
won't worry about the details of the sums of squares formulas but you should
remember the sums of squares decomposition, which still applies^[In the standard 
ANOVA table, 
$\text{SS}_A + \text{SS}_B + \text{SS}_{AB} + \text{SS}_E = \text{SS}_{\text{Total}}$. 
However, to get the tests we really desire when our designs are not balanced, a
slight modification of the SS is used, using what are called Type II sums of
squares and this result doesn't hold in the output you will see for additive
models. This is discussed further below.]. \index{sums of squares}
\index{ANOVA table}
Table \@ref(tab:Table4-1) 
summarizes the ANOVA results you will obtain for the interaction
model and Table \@ref(tab:Table4-2) provides the similar general results for the additive
model. As we saw in Chapter \@ref(chapter3), the degrees of freedom are the amount of
information that is free to vary at a particular level and that rule generally holds
here. For example, for factor A with $J$ levels, there are $J-1$ parameters that
are free since the baseline is fixed. The residual degrees of freedom for both
models are not as easily explained but have a simple formula. Note that the sum
of the degrees of freedom from the main effects, (interaction if present), and
error need to equal $N-1$, just like in the One-Way ANOVA table.

for us) and dividing by the $df$ in the row.

The $F$-ratios are found by taking
the mean squares from the row and dividing by the mean squared error ($\text{MS}_E$). 
They follow $F$-distributions with numerator degrees
of freedom from the row and denominator degrees of freedom from the Error row
(in R output this the ``Residuals`` row).

It is possible to develop permutation 
tests for these methods but some
technical issues arise in doing permutation tests for interaction model components
so we will not use them here. This means we will have to place even more
emphasis on the data not presenting clear violations of assumptions since we only have the parametric method
available.
\index{permutation}
\index{parametric}

\indent With some basic expectations about the ANOVA tables and $F$-statistic construction 
in mind, we can get to actually estimating the models and exploring the results. 
\index{ANOVA table}
The first example involves the fake paper towel data
displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-1) and \@ref(fig:Figure4-2). It appeared 
that Scenario 5 was the correct
story since the lines appeared to be non-parallel, but we need to know whether there is
sufficient evidence to suggest that the interaction is "real" and we get that through the 
interaction hypothesis test. To fit the interaction model using ``lm``, 
the general formulation is ``lm(y ~ x1 * x2, data = ...)``. The
order of the variables doesn't matter as the most important part of the model,
to start with, relates to the interaction of the variables. 
\index{\texttt{lm()}}

\indent The ANOVA table output
shows the results for the interaction model obtained by running the ``anova``
function on the model called ``m1``.
\index{ANOVA table}
Specifically, the test that 
$H_0: \text{ All } \omega_{jk}\text{'s} = 0$ has a
test statistic of $F(2,24) = 1.92$ (in the output from the row with 
brands:drops) and a p-value of 0.17. So there is weak evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction, with a 17% chance we would 
observe a difference in the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$ like we did or more
extreme if the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$ really were all 0. So we would conclude that the interaction is probably not needed^[This does not mean that there is truly no interaction in the population but does mean that we are going to proceed assuming it is not present since we couldn't prove the null was wrong.]. Note that for the interaction 
model components, R presents them with a colon, ``:``, between the variable 
names.

It is useful to display the estimates from this model and we can utilize
``plot(allEffects(MODELNAME))`` to visualize the results for the terms 
in our models. If we turn on the options for ``grid = T``, ``multiline = T``, 
and ``ci.style = "bars"`` we get a useful version of the basic 
"effect plot" for Two-Way ANOVA
models with interaction. I also added ``lty = c(1:2)`` to change the line type for the two lines (replace 2 with the number of levels in the variable driving the different lines. The results of the estimated interaction model are
displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-7), which looks very similar to our 
previous interaction plot. The only difference is that this comes from model 
that assumes equal variance and these plots show 95% confidence intervals 
for the means instead of the $\pm$ 1 SE used in the ``intplot`` where each SE is calculated using the variance of the observations at each combination of levels. Note that other than the lines connecting the means, this plot also is similar to the pirate-plot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-1) that also displayed the original responses for each of the six combinations of the two explanatory variables. That plot then provides a place to assess assumptions of the equal variance and distributions for each group as well as explore differences in the group means.

\indent In the absence of sufficient evidence to include the
interaction, the model should be simplified to the additive model and the interpretation
focused on each main effect, conditional on having the other variable in the
model. To fit an additive model and not include an interaction, the model
formula involves a "+" instead of a "``*``" between the explanatory variables. \index{\texttt{anova()}}

The p-values for the main effects of ``brand`` and ``drops`` change slightly from the
results in the interaction model due to changes in the $\text{MS}_E$ from
0.4118 to 0.4409 (more variability is left over in the simpler model) and the
$\text{DF}_{\text{error}}$ that increases from 24 to 26. In both models, the 
$\text{SS}_{\text{Total}}$ is the same (20.6544). In the interaction model, 

$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{SS}_{\text{Total}} & = \text{SS}_{\text{brand}} + \text{SS}_{\text{drops}}
+ \text{SS}_{\text{brand:drops}} + \text{SS}_{\text{E}}\\
& = 4.3322 + 4.8581 + 1.5801 + 9.8840\\
& = 20.6544.\\
\end{array}$$

In the additive model, the variability that was attributed to the interaction term
in the interaction model ($\text{SS}_{\text{brand:drops}} = 1.5801$) is pushed into the
$\text{SS}_{\text{E}}$, which increases from 9.884 to 11.4641. The sums of squares
decomposition in the additive model is 

$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{SS}_{\text{Total}} & = \text{SS}_{\text{brand}} + \text{SS}_{\text{drops}}
 + \text{SS}_{\text{E}} \\
& = 4.3322 + 4.8581 + 11.4641 \\
& = 20.6544. \\
\end{array}$$

This shows that the sums of squares decomposition applies in these more complicated
models as it did in the One-Way ANOVA.
\index{sums of squares}
It also shows that if the interaction is
removed from the model, that variability is lumped in with the other
unexplained variability that goes in the $\text{SS}_{\text{E}}$ in any model.

\indent The fact that the sums of squares decomposition can be applied here is 
useful, except that there is a small issue
with the main effect tests in the ANOVA table results that follow this
decomposition when the design is not balanced. It ends up that the tests in a
typical ANOVA table are only conditional on the tests higher up in the table. For
example, in the additive model ANOVA table, the ``Brand`` test is not 
conditional on the ``Drops`` effect, but the ``Drops`` effect is conditional on the 
``Brand`` effect. In balanced designs, conditioning on the other variable does not change the results but in unbalanced designs, the order does matter. To get both results to be similarly conditional on the other variable, we have to use another type of sums of 
squares, called ***Type II sums of squares***.
\index{sums of squares!Type II}
These sums of squares will no longer always 
follow the rules of the sums of squares decomposition but they
will test the desired hypotheses. Specifically, they provide each test
conditional on any other terms at the same level of the model and match the
hypotheses written out earlier in this section. To get the "correct" ANOVA
results, the ``car`` package (@R-car, @Fox2011) is required. We use the 
``Anova`` function on our linear models from here forward to get the "right" 
tests in our ANOVA tables^[The ``anova`` results are not wrong, just not what we want in all situations.].
\index{R packages!\textbf{car}}
Note how the case-sensitive nature of R code shows 
up in the use of the capital "A" ``Anova`` function instead of the lower-case "a" ``anova`` 
function used previously. In this situation, because the design was balanced, the
results are the same using either function. Observational studies rarely
generate balanced designs (some designed studies can result in unbalanced
designs too) so we will generally just use the Type II version of the sums of
squares to give us the desired results across different data sets we might analyze. The ``Anova`` results using the Type II sums of
squares are slightly more conservative than the results from ``anova``, 
which are called Type I sums of squares.
\index{sums of squares!Type I}
The sums of squares decomposition no
longer applies, but it is a small sacrifice to get each test after
adjusting for all other variables^[Actually, the tests are only conditional 
on other main effects if Type II Sums of Squares are used for an interaction 
model, but we rarely focus on the main effect tests when the interaction is present.].

The new output switches the columns around and doesn't show you the mean squares, 
but gives the most critical parts of the output. Here, there is no change in
results because it is a balanced design with equal counts of responses in each
combination of the two explanatory variables. 

\indent The additive model, when appropriate, provides simpler interpretations for 
each explanatory variable compared to models
with interactions because the effect of one variable is the same regardless of
the levels of the other variable and vice versa.
\index{model!additive}
There are two tools to aid in
understanding the impacts of the two variables in the additive model. First, 
the model summary provides estimated coefficients with interpretations like
those seen in Chapter \@ref(chapter3) (deviation of group $j$ or $k$ from 
the baseline group's mean), except with the additional wording of 
"controlling for" the other variable
added to any of the discussion. Second, the term-plots now show each main
effect and how the groups differ with one panel for each of the two explanatory
variables in the model. These term-plots are created by holding the other
variable constant at one of its levels (the most frequently occurring or first if the there are multiple groups tied for being most frequent) and presenting the estimated means across the levels of the variable in the plot.

\indent In the model summary, the baseline combination estimated in the ``(Intercept)``
row is for ``Brand`` *B1* and ``Drops`` 10 and estimates the mean failure 
time as 1.85 seconds for this combination. As
before, the group labels that do not show up are the baseline but there are two
variables' baselines to identify. Now the "simple" aspects of the additive
model show up. The interpretation of the ``Brands`` *B2* coefficient is as 
a deviation from the baseline but it applies regardless of the level of 
``Drops``. Any difference between *B1* and *B2* involves a shift up of 0.76 seconds
in the estimated mean failure time. Similarly, going from 10 (baseline) to 20
drops results in a drop in the estimated failure mean of 0.47 seconds and going
from 10 to 30 drops results in a drop of almost 1 second in the average time to
failure, both estimated changes are the same regardless of the brand of paper
towel being considered. Sometimes, especially in observational studies, we use
the terminology "controlled for" to remind the reader that the other variable
was present in the model^[In Multiple Linear Regression models in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter8), the reasons for this wording will (hopefully) 
become clearer.] and also explained some of the variability in the 
responses. The term-plots for
the additive model (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-8)) help us visualize the 
impacts of changes brand and changing water levels, holding the other 
variable constant. The differences in heights in each panel correspond 
to the coefficients just discussed.

\indent With the first additive model we have considered, it is now the first time where we are working with a model where we can't display the observations together with the means that the model is producing because the results for each predictor are averaged across the levels of the other predictor. To visualize some aspects of the original observations with the estimates from each group, we can turn on an option in the term-plots (``residuals = T``) to obtain the ***partial residuals*** \index{partial residuals} that show the residuals as a function of one variable after adjusting for the effects/impacts of other variables. We will avoid the specifics of the calculations for now, but you can use these to explore the residuals at different levels of each predictor. They will be most useful in the Chapters \@ref(chapter7) and \@ref(chapter8) but give us some insights in unexplained variation in each level of the predictors once we remove the impacts of other predictors in the model. Use plots like Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-9) to look for different variability at different levels of the predictors and locations of possible outliers in these models. Note that the points (open circles) are jittered to aid in seeing all of them, the means of each group of residuals are indicated by a filled large circle, and the smaller circles in the center of the bars for the 95% confidence intervals are the means from the model. Term-plots with partial residuals accompany our regular diagnostic plots for assessing equal variance assumptions in these models -- in some cases adding the residuals will clutter the term-plots so much that reporting them is not useful since one of the main purposes of the term-plots is to visualize the model estimates. So use the ``residuals = T`` option judiciously. 



(ref:fig4-9) Term-plots of additive model for paper towel data with partial residuals added. Relatively similar variability seems to be present in each of the groups of residuals after adjusting for the other variable except for the residuals for the 10 drops where the variability is smaller, especially if one small outlier is ignored.

</div>

For the One-Way and Two-Way interaction models, the partial residuals are just the original observations so present similar information as the pirate-plots but do show the model estimated 95% confidence intervals. With interaction models, you can use the default settings in ``effects`` when adding in the partial residuals as seen below in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-12).

## Guinea pig tooth growth analysis with Two-Way ANOVA	{#section4-4}

The effects of dosage and delivery method of ascorbic acid on Guinea Pig 
odontoblast growth was analyzed as a One-Way ANOVA in Section \@ref(section3-5)
by assessing evidence of any difference in the
means of any of the six combinations of dosage method (Vit C capsule vs Orange Juice) and
three dosage amounts (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day). Now we will consider the dosage
and delivery methods as two separate variables and explore their potential
interaction. A pirate-plot and interaction plot are provided in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-10).

(ref:fig4-10) Pirate-plot and interaction plot of the odontoblast growth data set.

ToothGrowth <- as_tibble(ToothGrowth)
```

\newpage


```r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
pirateplot(len ~ supp * dose, data = ToothGrowth, ylim = c(0,35),
         main = "Pirate-plot",  xlab = "Dosage", ylab = "Odontoblast Growth",
         inf.method = "ci", inf.disp = "line", theme = 2)
intplot(len ~ supp * dose, data = ToothGrowth, col = c(1,2), 
        main = "Interaction Plot", ylim = c(0,35))
```

It appears that the effect of method changes based on the dosage as the
interaction plot seems to show some evidence of non-parallel lines.
\index{non-parallel lines}
Actually, 
it appears that the effect of delivery method is the same (parallel lines) for doses 0.5 and 1.0
mg/day but that the effect of delivery method changes for 2 mg/day. 

\indent We can use the ANOVA $F$-test for an interaction to assess whether we think the 
interaction is "real" relative to the variability in the responses. 
\index{@$F$-test}
That is, is it larger than we would expect due to natural variation in the
data? If yes, then we think it is a real effect and we should account for it. The
following code fits the interaction model and provides an ANOVA table. 


```r
TG1 <- lm(len ~ supp * dose, data = ToothGrowth)
Anova(TG1)
```

```
## Anova Table (Type II tests)

```

The R output is reporting an interaction test result of $F(1,56) = 5.3$ with
a p-value of 0.025. But this should raise a red flag since the numerator 
degrees of freedom are not what we should expect based on Table \@ref(tab:Table4-1) of $(K-1)*(J-1) = (2-1)*(3-1) = 2$.
\index{degrees of freedom}
This brings up an issue in R when working
with categorical variables. If the levels of a categorical variable are entered
numerically, R will treat them as quantitative variables and not split out the
different levels of the categorical variable. To make sure that R treats
categorical variables the correct way, we should use the ``factor``
function on any variables^[This goes beyond our considerations with character variables that have text levels but are not declared as factors in the first chapters. Those often will be modeled correctly in linear models whether they are characters or factors -- but numerical variables will be modeled in a way that you did not intend for these predictors that we will discuss in Chapters \@ref(chapter7) and \@ref(chapter8).] that are categorical in meaning but are coded numerically in the data set. The following code creates a new variable called ``dosef``
using ``mutate`` and the ``factor`` function to help us obtain correct results from the linear 
model.
\index{\texttt{factor()}}
The re-run of the ANOVA table provides the correct analysis and the 
expected $df$ for the two rows of output involving ``dosef``:


```r
ToothGrowth <- ToothGrowth %>% mutate(dosef = factor(dose))
TG2 <- lm(len ~ supp * dosef, data = ToothGrowth)
Anova(TG2)
```

```
## Anova Table (Type II tests)

## supp:dosef  108.32  2   4.107 0.0218603
## Residuals   712.11 54
```

The ANOVA $F$-test for an interaction between supplement type and dosage level is 
$F(2,54) =  4.107$ with a p-value of 0.022. So there is moderate to strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction between *Dosage* and *Delivery method*, so we would likely conclude that there is an interaction present that we should discuss and this supports a changing effect on odontoblast growth of dosage based on the delivery
method in these guinea pigs. 

\indent Any similarities between this correct
result and the previous WRONG result are coincidence. I once
attended a Master's thesis defense where the results from a similar model were not as
expected (small p-values in places they didn't expect and large p-values in
places where they thought differences existed based on past results and plots of the data). During the presentation, the student
showed some ANOVA tables and the four level categorical variable had 1 numerator
$df$ in all ANOVA tables. The student
passed with *major* revisions but had to re-run **all** the results and re-write
**all** the conclusions...
\index{ANOVA table}
So be careful to check the ANOVA results ($df$
and for the right number of expected model coefficients) to make
sure they match your expectations. This is one reason why you will be learning
to fill in ANOVA tables based on information about the study so that you can be
prepared to detect when your code has let you down^[Just so you don't think 
that perfect R code should occur on the first try, I
have made similarly serious coding mistakes even after accumulating more
than decade of experience with R. It is finding those mistakes (in time) that matters.]. It
is also a great reason to explore term-plots and coefficient interpretations as
that can also help diagnose errors in model construction. 

\indent Getting back to the previous results, we now have enough background information 
to more formally write up a
focused interpretation of these results. The 6+ hypothesis testing steps in
this situation would be focused on first identifying that the best analysis
here is as a Two-Way ANOVA situation (these data were analyzed in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter3) as
a One-Way ANOVA but this version is likely better because it can explore whether there
is an interaction between delivery method and dosage).
\index{hypothesis testing}
We will focus on assessing the interaction. If
the interaction had been dropped, we would have reported the test results for the
interaction, then re-fit the additive model and used it to explore the main effect
tests and estimates for *Dose* and *Delivery method*. But since we are inclined to retain the interaction component in the model, the steps focus on the interaction.

0. The RQ is whether there is an interaction of dosage and delivery method on odontoblast growth. Data were collected at all combinations of these predictor variables on the size of the cells, so they can address the size of the cells in these condition combinations. The interaction $F$-test will be used to assess the research question.

1. **Hypotheses:**

    * $H_0$: No interaction between *Delivery method* and *Dose* on odontoblast
    growth in population of guinea pigs
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\omega_{jk}\text{'s} = 0$.
    
    * $H_A$: Interaction between *Delivery method* and *Dose* on odontoblast
    growth in population of guinea pigs
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ At least one $\omega_{jk}\ne 0$.
    
2. **Plot the data and assess validity conditions:**
\index{validity conditions!Two-Way ANOVA}

    * Independence: \index{independence assumption!Two-Way ANOVA}

        * There is no indication of an issue with this assumption because we 
        don't know of a reason why the independence of the measurements of odontoblast growth of
        across the guinea pigs as studied might be violated.
        
    * Constant variance:
    
        * To assess this assumption, we can use the pirate-plot in 
        Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-10), the diagnostic plots in
        Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-11), and by adding the partial residuals to 
        the term-plot^[To get ``dosef`` on the x-axis in the plot, the 
        ``x.var = "dosef"`` option was employed to force the *Dose* to be the
        variable on the x-axis.] as shown in \@ref(fig:Figure4-12).
        
        * In the Residuals vs Fitted and the Scale-Location plots, the
        differences in variability among the groups (see the different
        x-axis positions for each group's fitted values) is minor, so
        there is not strong evidence of a problem with the equal variance
        assumption. Similarly, the original pirate-plots and adding the partial
        residuals to the term-plot do not highlight big differences in
        variability at any of the combinations of the predictors, so do not
        suggest clear issues with this assumption.

        problem with this assumption. \index{QQ-plot}
      
Note that these diagnostics and conclusions are the same as in Section \@ref(section3-5)
because the interaction model and the One-Way ANOVA model with all six combinations
of the levels of the two variables fit exactly the same. But the RQ that we can
address differs due to the different model parameterizations.

\newpage

4. **Conclusion based on p-value:**

    * With a p-value of 0.0219 (from $F(2,54) = 4.107$), there is about a 2.19%
    chance we would observe an interaction like
    we did (or more extreme) if none were truly present. This provides moderate to strong
    evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction between delivery
    method and dosage on odontoblast growth in the population so we would
    conclude that there is likely an interaction and would retain the interaction in the model.
    
5. **Size of differences:**

    * See discussion below.

6. **Scope of Inference:**

    * Based on the random assignment of treatment levels, causal inference
    is possible (the changes due to dosage in the differences based on
    supplement type caused the differences in growth) but because the guinea
    pigs were not randomly selected, the inferences only pertain to these guinea pigs.
    

In a Two-Way ANOVA, we need to go a little further to get to the final "size" interpretations since the models are more complicated. When there is an
interaction present, we should focus on the term-plot of
the interaction model for an interpretation of the form and pattern of the
interaction.
\index{interaction plot}
If the interaction were unimportant, then the hypotheses and
results should focus on the additive model results, especially the estimated
model coefficients. To see why we don't usually discuss all the estimated
model coefficients in an interaction model, the six coefficients for this model are
provided:

\indent There are two $\widehat{\omega}_{jk}\text{'s}$ in the results, related to modifying the 
estimates for doses of 1 (-0.68) and 2
(5.33) for the Vitamin C group. If you want to re-construct the fitted values
from the model that are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-13), you have 
to look for any
coefficients that are "turned on" for a combination of levels of interest. For
example, for the OJ group (solid line), the 
dosage of 0.5 mg/day
has an estimate of an average growth of approximately 13 mm. This is the
baseline group, so the model estimate for an observation in the OJ and 0.5 mg/day
dosage is simply $\widehat{y}_{i,\text{OJ},0.5mg} = \widehat{\alpha} = 13.23$ microns. 
For the OJ and 2 mg/day dosage estimate that has a value over 25 microns in the
plot, the model incorporates the deviation for the 2 mg/day dosage:
$\widehat{y}_{i,\text{OJ},2mg} = \widehat{\alpha} + \widehat{\tau}_{2mg} = 13.23 + 12.83 = 26.06$
microns. For the Vitamin C group, another coefficient becomes involved from its "main
effect". For the VC and 0.5 mg dosage level, the estimate is approximately 8 microns.
The pertinent model components are 
$\widehat{y}_{i,\text{VC},0.5mg} = \widehat{\alpha} + \widehat{\gamma}_{\text{VC}} = 13.23 + (-5.25) = 7.98$
microns. Finally, when we consider non-baseline results for both groups, three
coefficients are required to reconstruct the results in the plot. For example, 
the estimate for the VC, 1 mg dosage is
$\widehat{y}_{i,\text{VC},1mg} = \widehat{\alpha} + \widehat{\tau}_{1mg} + \widehat{\gamma}_{\text{VC}} + \widehat{\omega}_{\text{VC},1mg} = 13.23 + 9.47 + (-5.25) +(-0.68) =  16.77$ microns. We usually will by-pass all this
fun(!) with the coefficients in an interaction model and go from the ANOVA
interaction test to focusing on the pattern of the responses in the interaction
plot or going to the simpler additive model, but it is good to know that there are still model coefficients driving
our results even if there are too many to be easily interpreted.

\indent Given the presence of an important
interaction, then the final step in the interpretation here is to interpret the
results in the interaction plot or term-plot of the interaction model, 
supported by the p-value suggesting a different effect of
supplement type based on the dosage level. To supplement this even more, 
knowing which combinations of levels differ can enhance our discussion. Tukey's
HSD results (specifically the CLD) can be added to the original interaction
plot by turning on the ``cld = T`` option in the ``intplot`` function as seen in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-14). Sometimes it is hard to see the letters and so
there is also a ``cldshift = ...`` option to move the letters up or down; here a 
value of 1 seemed to work. \index{Tukey's HSD} \index{compact letter display}

intplot(len ~ supp * dose, data = ToothGrowth, col = c(1,2), cldshift = 1,
        cld = T, main = "Interaction Plot with CLD")
```

\indent The "size" interpretation of the previous hypothesis test result could be something like the following: Generally increasing the dosage increases the mean growth except for
the 2 mg/day dosage level where the increase levels off in the OJ group (OJ 1
and 2 mg/day are not detectably different) and the differences between the two 
delivery methods disappear at the highest dosage level. But for 0.5 and 1 mg/day
dosages, OJ is clearly better than VC by about 10 microns of growth on average. 

## Observational study example: The Psychology of Debt	{#section4-5}

In this section, the analysis of a survey of $N = 464$ randomly sampled
adults will be analyzed from a survey conducted by @Lea1995
and available in the ``debt`` data set from the ``faraway`` package 
[@R-faraway].
\index{R packages!\textbf{faraway}}
The subjects responded to a variety of questions
including whether they buy cigarettes (``cigbuy``: 0 if
no, 1 if yes), their housing situation (``house``: 1 = rent, 2 = mortgage,
and 3 = owned outright), their income group (``incomegp``: 1 = 
lowest, 5 = highest), and their score on a continuous scale of attitudes about
debt (``prodebt``: 1 = least favorable, 6 = most favorable). The variable ``prodebt``
was derived as the average of a series of questions about debt with each
question measured on an ***ordinal*** 1 to 6 scale, with higher values 
corresponding to more positive responses about $\underline{\text{going into debt}}$
of various kinds. The ordered scale on surveys that try to elicit your opinions on
topics with scales from 1 to 5, 1 to 6, 1 to 7 or even, sometimes, 1 to 10 is called
a ***Likert scale*** [@Likert1932]. \index{ordinal} \index{Likert} It is not a quantitative scale and really 
should be handled more carefully than taking an average of a set responses as was done here. That 
said, it is extremely common practice in social science research to treat ordinal
responses as if they are quantitative and take the average of many of them to
create a more continuous response variable like the one we are using here. If
you continue your statistics explorations, you will see some better techniques
for analyzing ordinal responses. That said, the scale of the
response is relatively easy to understand as an amount of willingness to go
into debt on a scale from 1 to 6 with higher values corresponding to more
willingness to be in debt. 

\indent These data are typical of survey data where respondents were not required 
to answer all questions and there are some
missing responses. We could clean out any individuals that failed to respond to
all questions (called "complete cases") using the ``drop_na`` function, \index{\texttt{drop\_na()}} which will return responses only for subjects 
that responded to every question in
the data set, ``debt``. The change in sample size is available by running the ``dim`` \index{\texttt{dim}} function on the two data sets -- there were $464$ observations (rows) initially along with $13$ variables (columns) and once observations with any missing values were dropped there are $N = 304$ for us to analyze. Losing 35% of the observations is a pretty noticeable loss. 


```r
library(faraway)
data(debt)
library(tibble)
debt <- as_tibble(debt) %>% mutate(incomegp = factor(incomegp),
                                   cigbuy = factor(cigbuy)
                                   )
debtc <- debt %>% drop_na()

dim(debt)
```

```
## [1] 464  13
```

```r
dim(debtc)
```

```
## [1] 304  13
```

Using ``drop_na()`` with a list a variable names, we can focus on the three variables we are using in this model and whether the responses are missing on them, only cleaning out rows that are missing on ``incomegp``, ``cigbuy``, and/or ``prodebt``^[We can also use select to only retain these three variables and then ``drop_na()`` to get the same result for these three variables.]. The missingness is less dramatic, retaining $N = 388$ observations in ``debtRc`` for our analysis using these three variables.


```r
# Remove rows with missing values based on just three variables.
debtRc <- debt %>% drop_na(incomegp, cigbuy, prodebt)
dim(debtRc)
```

```
## [1] 388  13
```


\indent The second approach seems better as it drops fewer observations so we will use that below. But suppose that people did not want to
provide their income levels if they were in the lowest or highest
income groups and that is why they are missing. Then we would be missing responses systematically and conclusions
could be biased because of ignoring particular types of subjects. We don't have particular statistical tools to easily handle this problem but every researcher should worry about non-response when selected subjects do not respond at
all or fail to answer some questions. When the missing values are systematic in some fashion and not just missing randomly (missing randomly might be thought of as caused by "demonic intrusion" [@Hurlbert1984] that can't be easily explained or related to the types of responses), then we worry about ***non-response bias*** that is systematically biasing our results because of the missing responses. \index{demonic intrusion} \index{non-response bias} This also ties back into our discussion of who was sampled. We need to
think carefully about who was part of the sample but refused to participate and
how that might impact our inferences. And whether we can even address the research question of interest based on what was measured given those that refused/failed to respond. For example, suppose we are studying river flows and are interested in the height of a river. Missingness in these responses could arise because a battery fails or the data logger "crashes" (not related to the responses and so not definitely problematic) or because of something about the measurements to be taken that causes the missingness (suppose the gage can only can measure between one and three feet deep and the river is running at four feet deep during a flood or below 1 foot during a drought). The first machine failures are very different from the height-based missing responses; the height-based missingness clearly leads to bias in estimating mean river height because of what can not be observed. In Chapter \@ref(chapter5), we introduce the ``tableplot`` as another tool to visualize data that can also show missing data patterns to help you think about these sorts of issues further^[Correctly accounting for these missing data is a complex topic and you should not always engage ``drop_na()``, but the first step to handling missing data issues is to find out (1) if you have an issue, (2) how prevalent it is, and (3) whether it is systematic in any way -- in other words (and to date myself), "knowing is half the battle" with missing data. Consult a statistician or take more advanced statistics courses to explore this challenging topic further.]. If you delete observations and the missing data are not random/non-systematic, your scope of inference is restricted to just those subjects that provided responses and were analyzed. If the missingness is random and not related to aspects of the measurements taken, then some missingness can be tolerated and still retain some comfort that inferences can be extended to the population a random sample of subjects was taken from. 

\indent Ignoring this potential for bias in the
results for the moment, we are first interested in whether buying
cigarettes/not and income groups interact in their explanation of the
respondent's mean opinions on being in debt. The interaction plot 
(Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-15)) may suggest an interaction between ``cigbuy``
and ``incomegp`` where the lines cross, switching which of the ``cigbuy`` levels is higher (income levels 2, 3, and 5) or even almost not different (income levels 1 and 4). But it is 
not as clear as the previous examples, especially with how large the SEs are relative the variation in the means. The interaction $F$-test helps us
objectively assess evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction. Based on the plot, there do 
not appear to be differences based on cigarette purchasing but there might be some
differences between the income groups if we drop the interaction from the model. If we drop the interaction, then
this suggests that we might be in Scenario 2 or 3 where a single main effect of
interest is present. 


(ref:fig4-15) Interaction plot array of ``prodebt`` by income group (1 to 5) and whether they buy cigarettes (0 = no, 1 = yes).


```r
intplotarray(prodebt ~ cigbuy * incomegp, data = debtRc, col = c(1,3,4,5,6), lwd = 2)
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:Figure4-15)(ref:fig4-15)</p>
</div>

\indent As in other situations, and especially
with observational studies where a single large sample is collected and then the levels of the factor variables are observed, it is
important to check for balance -- whether all the combinations of the two
predictor variables are similarly represented.
\index{balance}
Even more critically, we need to
check whether all the combinations of levels of factors are measured. If a
combination is not measured, then we lose the ability to estimate the mean for
that combination and the ability to test for an interaction. A solution to that
problem would be to collapse the categories of one of the variables, changing
the definitions of the levels but if you fail to obtain information for all
combinations, you can't work with the interaction model. In this situation, we
barely have enough information to proceed (the smallest $n_{jk}$ is 13 for 
income group 4 that buys cigarettes). We have a very unbalanced design
with counts between 13 and 60 in the different combinations, so lose some resistance to violation of assumptions but can proceed to explore the model with a critical eye on how the diagnostic plots look. 



```r
tally(cigbuy ~ incomegp, data = debtRc)
```

```
##       incomegp
## cigbuy  1  2  3  4  5
##      0 36 49 54 53 60
##      1 37 45 20 13 21
```

\indent The test for the interaction is always
how we start our modeling in Two-Way ANOVA situations. The ANOVA table suggests
that there is little evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction between the income level and
buying cigarettes on the opinions of the respondents towards debt 
($F(4,378) = 0.686$, p-value = 0.6022), so we would conclude that there is likely not an interaction present here and we can drop the interaction from the model. This suggests that the initial assessment 
that the interaction wasn't too prominent
was correct. We should move to the additive model here but first need to check
the assumptions to make sure we can trust this initial test.

The diagnostic plots (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-16)) seem to be pretty 
well-behaved with no apparent
violations of the normality assumption and no clear evidence of a violation of
the constant variance assumption. There is no indication of a problem with the independence
assumption because there is no indication of structure to the measurements of the survey
respondents that might create dependencies. In observational studies, violations
of the independence assumption might come from repeated measures of the same
person over time or multiple measurements within the same family/household or samples
that are clustered geographically, none of which are part of the survey information we have.
\index{independence assumption!Two-Way ANOVA}
The random sampling from a population should
allow inferences to a larger population except for that issue of removing
partially missing responses so we can't safely generalize results beyond the complete observations we are using without worry that the missing subjects are systematically different from those we are able to analyze.
\index{random sampling}
We also don't have much information on the exact
population sampled, so will just leave this vague here but know that there would be a
population these conclusions apply since it was random sample (at least those that would answer the questions). All of this
suggests proceeding to fitting and exploring the additive model is reasonable
here. No causal inferences are possible because this is an observational study. 

0. After ruling out the interaction of income and cigarette status on opinions about debt, we can focus on the additive model.

1. **Hypotheses (Two sets apply when the additive model is the focus!):**

    * $H_0$: No difference in means for ``prodebt`` for income groups in 
    population, given cigarette buying in model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\tau_j\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 

    * $H_A$: Some difference in means for ``prodebt`` for income group in 
    population, given cigarette buying in model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ Not all $\tau_j\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model.

    * Constant Variance:
    
        * In the Residuals vs Fitted and the Scale-Location plots in 
        Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-17), the differences in variability among 
        groups is minor and nothing suggests a violation. **If you change

        \index{Residuals vs Fitted plot} \index{Scale-Location plot}
        
        * We can also explore the partial residuals here as provided in
        Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-18). The variability in the partial residuals
        appears to be similar across the different levels of each predictor,
        controlled for the other variable, and so does suggest any issues that
        were missed by just looking at the overall residuals versus fitted
        values in our regular diagnostic plots. Note how hard it is to see
        differences in the mean for levels of ``cigbuy`` in this plot relative
        to the variability in the partial residuals but that the differences in
        the means in ``incomegp`` are at least somewhat obvious.

    * The test statistics are $F(4,382) = 5.54$ and $F(1,382) = 0.0201$ with p-values of 0.00024 and 0.887. 
    
4. **Conclusions (including for the initial work with the interaction test):**

    * There was initially little to no evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction 
    between income group and cigarette buying on pro-debt feelings 
    ($F(4,378) = 0.686$, p-value = $0.6022$) so we would conclude that there is likely
    not an interaction in the population and the interaction was dropped 
    from the model. There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no
    difference in the mean pro-debt feelings in the population across the income groups, after
    adjusting for cigarette buying ($F(4,382) = 5.54$, p-value = $0.00024$), so we
    would conclude that there is some difference in them. There is little evidence
    against the null hypothesis of no difference in the mean pro-debt feelings in
    the population based on cigarette buying/not, after adjusting for income
    group ($F(1,382) = 0.0201$, p-value = $0.887$), so we would conclude that there
    is probably not a difference across cigarette buying/not and could consider
    dropping this term from the model. 
    
\indent So we learned that the additive model
was more appropriate for these responses and that the results resemble Scenario
2 or 3 with only one main effect being important. In the additive model, the
coefficients can be interpreted as shifts from the baseline after controlling
for the other variable in the model.

<!-- \newpage -->

5. **Size:**

    * Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-19) shows the increasing average comfort with being in
    debt as the income groups go up except between groups 1 and 2 where 1 is a little
    higher than two. Being a cigarette buyer was related to a lower comfort level
    with debt but is really no different from those that did not report buying
    cigarettes. It would be possible to consider follow-up tests akin to the Tukey's
    HSD comparisons for the levels of ``incomegp`` here but that is a bit beyond the
    scope of this course -- focus on the estimated mean for the 5^th^ income group
    being over 3.5 and none of the others over 3.2. That seems like an interesting
    although modest difference in mean responses across income groups after
    controlling for cigarette purchasing or not.

    </div>

6. **Scope of inference:**

    * Because the income group and cigarette purchasing were not (and really
    could not) be randomly assigned, causal inference is not possible here. The
    data set came from a random sample but from an unspecified population and
    then there were missing observations. At best we can make inferences to
    those in that population that would answer these questions and it would be
    nice to know more about the population to really understand who this
    actually applies to. There would certainly be concerns about non-response
    bias in doing inference to the entire population that these data were
    sampled from.

In the model, the baseline group is for non-cigarette buyers (``cigbuy = 0``)
and income group 1 with $\widehat{\alpha} = 3.131$ points. Regardless of the 
``cigbuy`` level, the difference between income groups 2 and 1 is estimated
to be $\widehat{\tau}_2 = -0.054$, an decrease in the mean score of 0.054 points. 
The difference between income groups 3 and 1 is $\widehat{\tau}_3 = 0.027$
points, regardless of cigarette smoking status. The estimated difference
between cigarette buyers and non-buyers was estimated as 
$\widehat{\gamma}_2 = -0.011$ points for any income group, remember that this 
variable had a large p-value in this model. The additive model-based estimates for all 
six combinations can be found in Table \@ref(tab:Table4-3).

\indent One final plot of the fitted values
from this additive model in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-20) hopefully crystallizes
the implications
of an additive model and reinforces that this model creates and assumes that
the differences across levels of one variable are the same regardless of the
level of the other variable and that this creates parallel lines. The
difference between ``cigbuy`` levels across all income groups is a drop in 
-0.011 points. The income groups
have the same differences regardless of cigarette buying or not, with income
group 5 much higher than the other four groups. The minor differences in cigarette purchasing and large p-value for it controlled for income group suggest that we could also refine the model further and drop the ``cigbuy`` additive term and just focus on the income groups as a predictor -- and this takes us right back to a One-Way ANOVA model so is not repeated here.

(ref:fig4-20) Illustration of the results from Table \@ref(tab:Table4-3) showing the combined impacts of the components of the additive model for ``prodebt``. Panel (a) uses income groups on the x-axis and different lines for cigarette buyers (1) or not (0).

<!-- \newpage -->

**In general, we proceed through the following steps in any 2-WAY ANOVA situation:**

1. Make a pirate-plot and an interaction plot. 

2. Fit the interaction model; examine the test for the interaction. 

3. Check the residual diagnostic plots for the interaction model (especially
normality and equal variance). 

    * If there is a problem with normality or
    equal variance, consider a "transformation" of the response as discussed in
    Chapter \@ref(chapter7). This can help make the responses have similar 
    variances or responses (and the model residuals) to be more normal, but
    sometimes not both. \index{transformation}

4. If the interaction test has a small p-value, that is your main result. Focus on
the term-plot and the interaction plot from (1) to fully understand the results, adding Tukey's
HSD \index{Tukey's HSD} results to ``intplot`` to see which means of the combinations of levels are detected as
being different. Discuss the sizes of differences and the pattern of the estimated interaction. 

5. If the interaction is not considered important, then re-fit the model without
the interaction (additive model) and re-check the diagnostic plots. If the
diagnostics are reasonable to proceed:

    * Focus on the results for each explanatory
    variable, using Type II tests especially if the design is not balanced.
    Possibly consider further model refinement to only retain one of the two
    variables (the one with the smaller p-value) if a p-value is large. Follow
    One-Way ANOVA recommendations from this point on.
    
    * Report the initial interaction test
    results and the results for the test for each variable from the model 
    that is re-fit without the interaction. 
    
    * Model coefficients in the additive model are interesting as they are shifts from baseline 
    for each level of each variable, controlling for the other variable -- 
    interpret those differences if the number of levels is not
    too great. 
    
Whether you end up favoring an additive or interaction model or do further model refinement, all steps of the
hypothesis testing protocol should be engaged and a story based on the final results should be compiled, supported by the graphical displays such as the term-plots and interaction plots.

## Pushing Two-Way ANOVA to the limit: Un-replicated designs and Estimability	{#section4-6}

\sectionmark{Pushing Two-Way ANOVA to the limit}

In some situations, it is too expensive
or impossible to replicate combinations of treatments and only one observation at each
combination of the two explanatory variables, A and B, is possible. In these
situations, even though we have information about all combinations of A and B, 
it is no longer possible to test for an interaction. Our regular rules for
degrees of freedom show that we have nothing left for the error degrees of
freedom and so we have to drop the interaction and call that potential
interaction variability "error". 
\index{degrees of freedom}
\index{replicate}

\newpage

\indent Without replication we can still perform an analysis of the
responses and estimate all the coefficients in the interaction model but an issue occurs with trying to calculate the interaction 
$F$-test statistic -- we run out of degrees of freedom for the error. To 
illustrate these methods, the paper towel example
is revisited except that only one response for each combination is used. Now
the entire data set can be easily printed out:


```r
ptR <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/ptR.csv")
ptR <- ptR %>% mutate(dropsf = factor(drops),
                      brand = factor(brand))
ptR
```


```
## # A tibble: 6 x 4
##   brand drops responses dropsf
##   <fct> <dbl>     <dbl> <fct> 
## 1 B1       10     1.91  10    
## 2 B2       10     3.05  10    
## 3 B1       20     0.774 20    
## 4 B2       20     2.84  20    
## 5 B1       30     1.56  30    
## 6 B2       30     0.547 30
```

Upon first inspection the interaction plot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-21)
looks like there might be
some interesting interactions present with lines that look to be non-parallel. But remember now that there is only a
single observation at each combination of the brands and water levels so there
is not much power to detect differences in this sort of situation and no replicates
at any combinations of levels that allow estimation of SEs so no bands are produced in the
plot. \index{replicate}

\indent The next step would be to assess evidence related to the null hypothesis
of no interaction between ``Brand`` and ``Drops``. A problem will arise in
trying to form the ANOVA table as you would see this when you run the 
``anova``^[We switched back to the ``anova`` function here as the ``Anova``
function only reports ``Error in Anova.lm(lm(responses ~ dropsf * brand,
data = ptR)) : residual df = 0``, which is fine but not as useful for
understanding this issue as what ``anova`` provides.] function on the
interaction model: \index{\texttt{anova()}}

```

<!-- \normalsize -->

Warning messages in R output show up after you run functions that contain
problems and are generally not a good thing, but can sometimes be ignored. In
this case, the warning message is not needed -- there are no $F$-statistics or 
p-values in the results so we know there are some issues with the results. The 
**Residuals** line is key here -- Residuals with 0 *df* and sums of
squares of 0. Without replication, there are no degrees of freedom left to 
estimate the residual error. My first statistics professor, 
Dr. Gordon Bril at Luther College, used to refer to this as "shooting your load" by
fitting too many terms in the model given the number of observations available. 
Maybe this is a bit graphic but hopefully will help you remember the need for
replication if you want to test for interactions -- it did for me. Without
replication of observations, we run out of information to test all
the desired model components. 

\indent So what can we do if we can't afford replication but want to study two variables in the same study? We can *assume* that the 
interaction does not exist and use those degrees of freedom and variability as 
the error variability. When we drop the interaction from Two-Way
models, the interaction variability is added into the $\text{SS}_E$
so we assume that the interaction variability is really just "noise", which may not actually be true. We are not able to test for an 
interaction so must rely on the interaction plot to assess whether an interaction 
might be present. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-20) suggests there might be an 
interaction in these data (the
two brands' lines suggesting non-parallel lines).
\index{non-parallel lines}
So in this
case, assuming no interaction is present is hard to justify. But if we proceed
under this dangerous and untestable assumption, tests for the main effects can be developed. 
\index{interaction plot}



```r
norep1 <- lm(responses ~ dropsf + brand, data = ptR)
Anova(norep1)

## brand     0.80663  1  0.6485 0.5052
## Residuals 2.48773  2
```

In the additive model, the last row of the ANOVA table that is called the 
``Residuals`` row is really the interaction row from the interaction model 
ANOVA table. Neither main effect had a small p-value 
(*Drops*: $F(2,2) = 0.82, \text{ p-value} = 0.55$ and 
*Brand*: $F(1,2) = 0.65, \text{ p-value} = 0.51$) in the additive model. To 
get small p-values with the small sample sizes that unreplicated designs would generate, the differences would need to be
**very** large because the residual degrees of freedom have become very small.
\index{degrees of freedom} \index{replicate}
The term-plots in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-22) show that the
differences among the levels are small relative to the residual variability as
seen in the error bars around each point estimate.

</div>


\indent In the extreme unreplicated situation it is possible to estimate all model coefficients in the interaction model but we can't do inferences for those estimates since there is no residual variability. Another issue in really any model with categorical predictors but especially noticeable in the Two-Way ANOVA situation is ***estimability*** issues. \index{estimability} Instead of having issues with running out of degrees of freedom for tests we can run into situations where we do not have information to estimate some of the model coefficients. This happens any time you fail to have observations at either a level of a main effect or at a combination of levels in an interaction model. 

\indent To illustrate estimability issues, we will revisit the overtake data. Each of the seven levels of outfits was made up of a combination of different characteristics of the outfits, such as which helmet and pants were chosen, whether reflective leg clips were worn or not, etc. To see all these additional variables, we will introduce a new plot that will feature more prominently in Chapter \@ref(chapter5) that allows us to explore relationships among a suite of categorical variables -- the `tableplot` from the ``tabplot``^[This is the first package we have encountered that is not on the "CRAN" repository and we will need to install it from its "github" repository. This happens for packages in early development and for other packages where researchers decide to avoid the ongoing challenges involved maintaining the package status on CRAN. In order to install this package, we can use the following code after installing the `remotes` [@R-remotes] package in the regular way: `library(remotes); remotes::install_github("mtennekes/tabplot")`] package [@R-tabplot]. It allows us to sort the variables based on a single variable (think about how you might sort a spreadsheet based on one column and look at the results in other columns). The ``tableplot`` function displays bars for each response in a row^[In larger data sets, 
multiple subjects are displayed in each row as proportions of
the rows in each category.] based on the 
category of responses or as a bar with the height corresponding
the value of quantitative variables^[Quantitative variables are displayed with
boxplot-like bounds to describe the variability in the variable for that row of 
responses for larger data sets.].
\index{\texttt{tableplot()}}
\index{R packages!\textbf{tabplot}}
It also plots a red cell if the
observations were missing for a categorical variable and in grey for missing values on quantitative variables. The plot can be obtained
simply as ``tableplot(DATASETNAME)`` which will sort the data set based on the first variable. To use our previous work with the sorted levels of ``Condition2``, the code ``dd[,-1]`` is used to specify the data set without ``Condition`` and then ``sort = Condition2`` is used to sort based on the ``Condition2`` variable. The ``pals = list("BrBG")`` option specifies a color palette for the plot that is color-blind friendly from the ``RColorBrewer`` package [@R-RColorBrewer].

\indent In the tableplot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-23), we can now explore the six variables created related to aspects of each outfit. For example, the *commuter* helmet (darkest shade in ``Helmet`` column) was worn with all outfits except for the *racer* and *casual*. So maybe we would like to explore differences in overtake distances based on the type of helmet worn. Similarly, it might be nice to explore whether wearing reflective pant clips is useful and maybe there is an interaction between helmet type and leg clips on impacts on overtake distance (should we wear both or just one, for example). So instead of using the seven level ``Condition2`` in the model to assess differences based on all combinations of these outfits delineated in the other variables, we can try to fit a model with ``Helmet`` and ``ReflectClips`` and their interaction for overtake distances:

The full model summary shows some odd things. First there is a warning after ``Coefficients`` of ``(3 not defined because of singularities)``. And then in the coefficient table, there are ``NA``s for everything in the rows for ``ReflectClipsyes`` and the two interaction components. When ``lm`` encounters models where the data measured are not sufficient to estimate the model, it essentially drops parts of the model that you were hoping to estimate and only estimates what it can. In this case, it just estimates coefficients for the intercept and two deviation coefficients for ``Helmet`` types; the other three coefficients ($\gamma_2$ and the two $\omega$s) are *not estimable*. This reinforces the need to check coefficients in any model you are fitting. A tally of the counts of observations across the two explanatory variables helps to understand the situation and problem:


```r
tally(Helmet ~ ReflectClips, data = dd)
```

```
##           ReflectClips
## Helmet       no  yes
##   commuter    0 4059
##   hat       779    0
##   race        0  852
```

There are three combinations that have $n_{jk} = 0$ observations (for example for the *commuter* helmet, clips were always worn so no observations were made with this helmet without clips). So we have no hope of estimating a mean for the combinations with 0 observations and these are needed to consider interactions. If we revisit the tableplot, we can see how some of these needed combinations do not occur together. So this is an unbalanced design but also lacks necessary information to explore the potential research question of interest. In order to study just these two variables and their interaction, the researchers would have had to do rides with all six combinations of these variables. This could be quite informative because it could help someone tailor their outfit choice for optimal safety but also would have created many more than seven different outfit combinations to wear.

\indent Hopefully by pushing the limits there
are three conclusions available from this section. First, replication is
important, both in being able to perform tests for interactions and for having
enough power to detect differences for the main effects. Second, when dropping 
from the interaction model to additive model, the variability explained by the
interaction term is pushed into the error term, whether replication is
available or not. Third, we need to make sure we have observations at all combinations of variables if we want to be able to estimate models using them and their interaction.

## Chapter summary	{#section4-7}

In this chapter, methods for handling two different categorical predictors 
in the same model with a
continuous response were developed. The methods build on techniques from
Chapter \@ref(chapter3) for the One-Way ANOVA and there are connections 
between the two
models. This was most clearly seen in the Guinea Pig data set that was analyzed
in both chapters. When two factors are available, it is better to start with
the methods developed in this chapter because the interaction between the
factors can, potentially, be separated from their main effects. The additive
model is easier to interpret but should only be used when you are not convinced that there is an
interaction is present. When an interaction is determined to be present, the
main effects should not be interpreted and the interaction plot in combination
with Tukey's HSD provides information on the important aspects of the results. 

* If the interaction is retained in the model, there are two things you want 
to do with interpreting the interaction:

    1. Describe the interaction, going through the changes from left to right 
    in the interaction plot or term-plot for each level of the other variable. 
    
    2. Suggest optimal and worst combinations of the two variables to describe the highest and lowest possible estimated mean responses. 
    
        a. For example, you might want to identify a dosage and delivery 
        method for the guinea pigs to recommend and one to avoid if you 
        want to optimize odontoblast growth. 
        
* If there is no interaction, then the additive model provides information 
on each of the variables and the differences across levels of each variable 
are the same regardless of the levels of the other variable. 

    * You can describe the deviations from baseline as in Chapter \@ref(chapter3),
    but for each variable, noting that you are controlling for the other variable. 

\indent Some statisticians might have different
recommendations for dealing with interactions and main effects, especially in
the context of models with interactions. We have chosen to focus on tests for
interactions to screen for "real" interactions and then interpret the
interaction plots aided by the Tukey's HSD for determining which combinations
of levels are detectably different. Some suggest exploring the main
effects tests even with interactions present. In some cases, those results are
interesting but in others the results can be misleading and we wanted to avoid
trying to parse out the scenarios when it might be safe to focus on the main effects in the presence of important interactions. Consider two scenarios, one where
the main effects have large p-values but the interaction has a small p-value
and the other where the main effects and the interaction all have small
p-values. The methods discussed in this chapter allow us to effectively arrive
at the interpretation of the differences in the results across the combinations
of the treatments due to the interaction having a small p-value in both cases. The main
effects results are secondary results at best when the interaction is important
because we know that impacts of one explanatory variable is changing based on
the levels of the other variable. 

\indent Chapter \@ref(chapter5) presents a bit of a different set of statistical 
methods that allow analyses of data sets similar
to those considered in the last two chapters but with a categorical response
variable. The methods are very different in application but are quite similar in overall goals
to those in Chapter \@ref(chapter3) where differences in responses where explored 
across groups. After Chapter \@ref(chapter5), the rest of the book will 
return to fitting models using the ``lm`` function as used here, but 
incorporating quantitative predictor variables and
then eventually incorporating both categorical and quantitative predictor
variables. The methods in Chapter \@ref(chapter8) are actually quite similar 
to those considered here, so the better you understand these models, the easier that material will be to master.

## Practice problems	{#section4-9}

4.1. **Mathematics Usage Test Scores Analysis** To practice the Two-Way ANOVA, consider a data set on $N = 861$ ACT
Mathematics Usage Test scores from 1987. The test was given to a 
sample of high school seniors who met one of three profiles of high school 
mathematics course
work: (a) Algebra I only; (b) two Algebra courses and Geometry; and (c) two
Algebra courses, Geometry, Trigonometry, Advanced Mathematics, and Beginning
Calculus. These data were generated from summary statistics for one particular
form of the test as reported by @Doolittle1989. The source of this version of
the data set is @Ramsey2012 and the ``Sleuth3`` package 
[@R-Sleuth3]. \index{R packages!\textbf{Sleuth3}}
First install and then load that package. 

```
library(Sleuth3)
library(mosaic)
library(tibble)
math <- as_tibble(ex1320)
math
names(math)
favstats(Score ~ Sex + Background, data = math)
``` 

4.1.1. Use the ``favstats`` summary to discuss whether the design was balanced or not. 

4.1.2. Make a pirate-plot and
interaction plot array of the results and discuss the relationship between Sex, 
Background, and ACT Score. 

4.1.3. Write out the interaction model in
terms of the Greek letters, making sure to define all the terms and don't
forget the error terms in the model. 

4.1.4. Fit the interaction plot and find
the ANOVA table. For the test you should consider first (the interaction), 
write out the hypotheses, report the test statistic, p-value, distribution of
the test statistic under the null, and write a conclusion related to the
results of this test. 

4.1.5. Re-fit the model as an additive
model (why is this reasonable here?) and use ``Anova`` to find the Type II sums of
squares ANOVA. Write out the hypothesis for the Background variable, report the
test statistic, p-value, distribution of the test statistic under the null, and
write a conclusion related to the results of this test. Make sure to discuss the scope of inference for this result.

4.1.6. Use the ``effects`` package to make a term-plot from the
additive model from 4.5 and discuss the results. Specifically, discuss what you
can conclude about the average relationship across both sexes, between
Background and average ACT score?

4.1.7. Add partial residuals to the term-plot and make our standard diagnostic plots
and assess the assumptions using these plots. Can you assess independence using
these plots? Discuss this assumption in this situation. 

4.1.8. Use the term-plot and the estimated model
coefficients to determine which of the combinations of levels provides the
highest estimated average score.

\vspace{11pt}

4.2. **Sleep Quality Analysis** As a second example, consider data based on Figure 3 from @Puhan2006, which is
available at http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7536/266. In this study, the 
researchers were interested in whether didgeridoo playing might impact sleep 
quality (and therefore daytime sleepiness). They obtained volunteers and they
randomized the subjects to either get a lesson or be placed on a waiting list 
for lessons. They constrained the randomization based on the high/low apnoea 
and high/low on the Epworth scale of the subjects in their initial observations 
to make sure they balanced the types of subjects going into the treatment and 
control groups. They measured the subjects' Epworth value (daytime sleepiness, 
higher is more sleepy) initially and after four months, where only the treated
subjects (those who took lessons) had any intervention. We are interested in 
whether the mean Epworth scale values changed differently over the four months 
in the group that got didgeridoo lessons than it did in the control group (that 
got no lessons). Each subject was measured twice in the data set provided that 
is available at http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/epworthdata.csv.

\small

```r
library(readr)
epworthdata <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/epworthdata.csv")
epworthdata <- epworthdata %>% mutate(Time = factor(Time),
                                      Group = factor(Group)
                                      )
levels(epworthdata$Time) <- c("Pre" , "Post")
levels(epworthdata$Group) <- c("Control" , "Didgeridoo")
```

\normalsize

4.2.1. Make a pirate-plot and an interaction plot array to graphically explore
the potential interaction of Time and Group on the Epworth responses.

4.2.2. Fit the interaction model and find
the ANOVA table. For the test you should consider first (the interaction), 
write out the hypotheses, report the test statistic, p-value, distribution of
the test statistic under the null, and write a conclusion related to the
results of this test.

4.2.3. Discuss the independence assumption for the previous model. The researchers used an analysis based on matched pairs. Discuss how using ideas from matched pairs might be applicable to the scenario discussed here.

4.2.4. Refine the model based on the previous test result and continue refining the model as the results might suggest. This should lead to retaining just a single variable. Make term-plot plot for this model and discuss this result related to the intent of the original research. If you read the original paper, they did find evidence of an effect of learning to play the didgeridoo (that there was a different change over time in the treated control when compared to the control group) -- why might they have gotten a different result (hint: think about the previous question). 

Note that the didgeridoo example is revisited in the case-studies in Chapter \@ref(chapter9) with some information on an even better way to analyze these data.
