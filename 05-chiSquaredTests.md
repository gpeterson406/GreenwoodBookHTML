# Chi-square tests {#chapter5}






## Situation, contingency tables, and tableplots	{#section5-1}

In this chapter, the focus shifts briefly from analyzing quantitative 
response variables to methods
for handling categorical response variables. This is important because in some
situations it is not possible to measure the response variable quantitatively. 
For example, we will analyze the results from a clinical trial where the results
for the subjects were measured as one of three categories: *no improvement*, 
*some improvement*, and *marked improvement*. While that type of response 
could be treated as
numerical, coded possibly as 1, 2, and 3, it would be difficult to assume that
the responses such as those follow a normal distribution since they are 
***discrete*** (not continuous, measured at whole number values only) and, 
more importantly, 
the difference between *no improvement* and *some improvement* is not 
necessarily the same as the difference between *some* and *marked improvement*. 
If it is treated numerically, then the differences between levels are assumed to be the same
unless a different coding scheme is used (say 1, 2, and 5). It is better to
treat this type of responses as being in one of the three categories and use
statistical methods that don't make unreasonable and arbitrary assumptions about what the
numerical coding might mean. The study being performed here involved subjects
randomly assigned to either a treatment or a placebo (control) group and we
want to address research questions similar to those considered in 
Chapters \@ref(chapter2) and \@ref(chapter3) --
assessing differences in a response variable among two or more groups. With quantitative
responses, the differences in the distributions are parameterized via the means
of the groups and we used linear models. With
categorical responses, the focus is on the probabilities of getting responses in
each category and whether they differ among the groups. 

\indent We start with some useful summary techniques, both numerical and graphical, 
applied to some examples of
studies these methods can be used to analyze. Graphical techniques provide
opportunities for assessing specific patterns in variables, relationships
between variables, and for generally understanding the responses obtained. 
There are many different types of plots and each can elucidate certain features
of data. The *tableplot*, briefly introduced^[Install the `tabplot` package from the authors' github repository using `library(remotes); 
remotes::install_github("mtennekes/tabplot")` if you haven't already done so.] in Chapter \@ref(chapter4), is a great and often fun starting point for working with data sets that contain categorical variables. We will start here with using it to help us
understand some aspects of the results from a double-blind randomized clinical
trial investigating a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.
\index{tableplot}
These data are available
in the ``Arthritis`` data set available in the ``vcd`` package [@R-vcd].
\index{R packages!\textbf{vcd}}
There were $n=84$ subjects, with some demographic 
information recorded
along with the ``Treatment`` status (*Treated*, *Placebo*) and whether the 
patients' arthritis symptoms ``Improved`` (with levels of *None*, *Some*, 
and *Marked*). When using ``tableplot``, we may 
not want to display everything in the tibble and can just select some 
of the variables. We use ``Treatment``, ``Improved``, ``Gender``, and ``Age``
in the ``select=...`` option with a ``c()`` and commas between the names of 
the variables we want to display as shown below. The first one in the list is also the one that
the data are sorted on and is what we want here -- to start with sorting observations based on ``Treatment`` status.

tableplot(Arthritis,select=c(Treatment,Improved,Sex,Age), pals=list("BrBG"), sample=F,
          colorNA_num = "orange", numMode = "MB-ML")
```

![(\#fig:Figure5-1)(ref:fig5-1)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-1-1.pdf) 

\indent The first thing we can gather from Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-1) is that there 
are no red cells so there were no missing
observations in the data set. Missing observations regularly arise in real
studies when observations are not obtained for many different reasons and it is
always good to check for missing data issues -- this plot provides a quick visual
method for doing that check. Primarily we are interested in whether the
treatment led to a different pattern (or rates) of improvement responses. There
seems to be more light (*Marked*) improvement responses in the treatment 
group and more dark (*None*) responses in the placebo group. 
This sort of plot also helps us to simultaneously consider the role of other
variables in the observed responses. You can see the sex of each subject in the
vertical panel for ``Sex`` and it seems
that there is a relatively balanced mix of males and females in the
treatment/placebo groups. Quantitative variables are also displayed with
horizontal bars corresponding to the responses (the x-axis provides the units of the responses, here in years). From the panel for 
``Age``, we can see that the ages of subjects ranged from the 20s to 70s 
and that there is no clear difference in
the ages between the treated and placebo groups. If, for example, all the male
subjects had ended up being randomized into the treatment group, then we might
have worried about whether sex and treatment were confounded and whether any
differences in the responses might be due to sex instead of the treatment. The
random assignment of treatment/placebo to the subjects appears to have been
successful here in generating a mix of ages and sexes among the
two treatment groups^[While randomization is typically useful in trying to "equalize" the composition of groups, a possible randomization of subjects to the groups is to put all the males into the treatment group. Sometimes we add additional constraints to randomization of subjects to treatments to guarantee that we don't get stuck with an unusual and highly unlikely assignment like that. It is important at least to check the demographics of different treatment groups to see if anything odd occurred.]. The main benefit of this sort of plot is the ability to
visualize more than two categorical variables simultaneously. But now we want
to focus more directly on the researchers' main question -- does the treatment
lead to different improvement outcomes than the placebo?

\indent To directly assess the effects of the treatment, we
want to display just the two variables of interest. ***Stacked bar charts***
provide a method of displaying the response patterns (in ``Improved``) across 
the levels of a predictor variable (``Treatment``) by displaying a bar for each
predictor variable level and the proportions of responses in each category of
the response in each of those groups. If the placebo is as effective as the
treatment, then we would expect similar proportions of responses in each
improvement category. A difference in the effectiveness would manifest in
different proportions in the different improvement categories between *Treated* 
and *Placebo*. To get information in this direction, we start with
obtaining the counts in each combination of categories using the ``tally``
function to generate contingency tables.
\index{\texttt{tally()}}
***Contingency tables*** with 
***R*** rows and ***C*** columns (called ***R by C tables***) summarize 
the counts of observations in each combination of the explanatory and 
response variables.
\index{contingency table}
In these data, there are $R=2$ rows and $C=3$ columns 
making a $2\times 3$ table -- note that you do not count the row
and column for the "Totals" in defining the size of the table. In the table, 
there seems to be many more *Marked* improvement responses (21 vs 7) and 
fewer *None* responses (13 vs 29) in the treated group compared to the 
placebo group. 


```r
library(mosaic)
tally(~Treatment+Improved, data=Arthritis, margins=T)
```

```
##          Improved
## Treatment None Some Marked Total
##   Placebo   29    7      7    43
##   Treated   13    7     21    41
##   Total     42   14     28    84
```

Using the ``tally`` function with ``~x+y`` provides a contingency table with
the ``x`` variable on the rows and the ``y`` variable on the columns, with
``margins=T`` as an option so we can obtain the totals along the rows, 
columns, and table total of $N=84$.
\index{\texttt{tally()}}
\index{contingency table}
In general, contingency tables contain 
the counts $n_{rc}$ in the $r^{th}$ row and $c^{th}$ column where
$r=1,\ldots,R$ and $c=1,\ldots,C$. We can also define the ***row totals***
as the sum across the columns of the counts in row $r$ as

$$\mathbf{n_{r\bullet}}=\Sigma^C_{c=1}n_{rc},$$

the ***column totals*** as the sum across the rows for the counts in column $c$ as

$$\mathbf{n_{\bullet c}}=\Sigma^R_{r=1}n_{rc},$$

and the ***table total*** as

$$\mathbf{N}=\Sigma^R_{r=1}\mathbf{n_{r\bullet}} = \Sigma^C_{c=1}\mathbf{n_{\bullet c}}
= \Sigma^R_{r=1}\Sigma^C_{c=1}\mathbf{n_{rc}}.$$

We'll need these quantities to do some calculations in a bit. A generic 
contingency table with added row, column, 
and table totals just like the previous result from the ``tally``
function is provided in Table \@ref(tab:Table5-1).

Table: (\#tab:Table5-1) (ref:tab5-1)

\indent Comparing counts from the contingency table is useful, but comparing proportions
in each category is better, especially when the sample sizes in the levels of 
the explanatory variable differ. Switching the formula used in the ``tally ``
function formula to ``~ y|x`` and adding the ``format="proportion"``
option provides the proportions in the response categories conditional on the 
category of the predictor (these are
called ***conditional proportions*** or the ***conditional distribution*** of, 
here, *Improved* on *Treatment*)^[The vertical line, "``|``", in ``~ y|x``
is available on most keyboards on the same key as "``\``". It is the mathematical 
symbol that means "conditional on" whatever follows.]. 
\index{\texttt{tally()}}
Note that they sum to 1.0 in each level of x, *placebo* or *treated*:


```r
tally(~Improved|Treatment, data=Arthritis, format="proportion", margins=T)
```

```
##         Treatment
## Improved   Placebo   Treated
##   None   0.6744186 0.3170732
##   Some   0.1627907 0.1707317
##   Marked 0.1627907 0.5121951
##   Total  1.0000000 1.0000000
```

This version of the ``tally`` result switches the variables between the rows and columns from the 
first summary of the data but the single
"Total" row makes it clear to read the proportions down the columns in this
version of the table.
\index{\texttt{tally()}}
In this application, it shows how the proportions seem to be different among categories of *Improvement* between the placebo and treatment groups. This matches the previous thoughts on
these data, but now a difference of marked improvement of 16% vs 51% is more
clearly a big difference. We can also display this result using a 
***stacked bar chart***^[Technically this is a `spineplot` as it generalizes the stacked bar chart based on the proportion of the total in each vertical bar.] \index{stacked bar chart} that displays the same information using the ``plot``
function with a ``y~x`` formula:

(ref:fig5-2) Stacked bar chart of Arthritis data. The left bar is for the Placebo group and the right bar is for the Treated group. The width of the bars is based on relative size of each group and the portion of the total height of each shaded area is the proportion of that group in each category. The lightest shading is for "none", medium shading for "some", and the darkest shading for "marked", as labeled on the y-axis.


```r
par(las=2) #Rotates text labels, optional code
plot(Improved~Treatment, data=Arthritis,
     main="Stacked Bar Chart of Arthritis Data")
```

![(\#fig:Figure5-2)(ref:fig5-2)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-2-1.pdf) 

\indent The stacked bar chart in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-2) displays the previous 
conditional proportions for the groups, with
the same relatively clear difference between the groups persisting. If you run
the ``plot`` function with variables that are
coded numerically, it will make a very different looking graph (R is smart!) so
again be careful that you are instructing R to treat your variables as
categorical if they really are categorical. R is powerful but can't read your
mind!

\indent In this chapter, we analyze data collected in two different fashions and 
modify the hypotheses to
reflect the differences in the data collection processes, choosing either
between what are called Homogeneity and Independence tests. The previous
situation where levels of a treatment are randomly assigned to the subjects in
a study describes the situation for what is called a ***Homogeneity Test***.
\index{Chi-Square Test!Homogeneity Test}
Homogeneity also applies when random samples are taken from each population of
interest to generate the observations in each group of the explanatory variable based on the population groups. 
\index{random sampling}
These sorts of situations resemble many of the examples from 
Chapter \@ref(chapter3) where treatments were assigned to subjects. The other 
situation considered is where a
single sample is collected to represent a population and then a contingency
table is formed based on responses on two categorical variables.
\index{contingency table}
When one
sample is collected and analyzed using a contingency table, the appropriate
analysis is called a Chi-square test of ***Independence*** or ***Association***.
\index{Chi-Square Test!Independence Test}
In this
situation, it is not necessary to have variables that are clearly classified
as explanatory or response although it is certainly possible. Data that often 
align with Independence testing are collected using surveys of
subjects randomly selected from a single, large population. An example, 
analyzed below, involves a survey of voters and whether their party affiliation
is related to who they voted for -- the republican, democrat, or other
candidate. There is clearly an explanatory variable of the *Party affiliation*
but a single large sample was taken from the population of all likely voters 
so the Independence test needs to be applied. 
Another example where Independence is appropriate involves a study of student
cheating behavior. Again, a single sample was taken from the population of
students at a university and this determines that it will be an Independence
test. Students responded to questions about lying to get out of turning in a
paper and/or taking an exam (*none*, *either*, or *both*) and copying on an 
exam and/or turning in a paper written by
someone else (*neither*, *either*, or *both*). In this situation, it is not 
clear which variable is response or explanatory (which should explain the other) and it does not matter
with the Independence testing framework.
\index{Chi-Square Test!Independence Test}
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-3) contains 
a diagram of the
data collection processes and can help you to identify the appropriate analysis
situation.

(ref:fig5-3) Diagram of the scenarios involved in Homogeneity and Independence tests. Homogeneity testing involves R random samples or subjects assigned to R groups. Independence testing involves a single random sample and measurements on two categorical variables. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{chapter5_files/image027} 

}

\caption{(ref:fig5-3)}(\#fig:Figure5-3)
\end{figure}

\indent You will discover that the test statistics are the same for both methods, 
which can create some desire
to assume that the differences in the data collection don't matter. In
Homogeneity designs, the sample size in each group
$(\mathbf{n_{1\bullet}},\mathbf{n_{2\bullet},\ldots,\mathbf{n_{R\bullet}}})$
is fixed (researcher chooses the size of each group).
\index{Chi-Square Test!Homogeneity Test}
In Independence situations, the total sample size $\mathbf{N}$ is
fixed but all the $\mathbf{n_{r\bullet}}\text{'s}$ are random (we need the data set to know how many are in each group).
\index{Chi-Square Test!Independence Test}
These
differences impact the graphs, hypotheses, and conclusions used even though
the test statistics and p-values are calculated the same way -- so we only
need to learn one test statistic to handle the two situations, but we need
to make sure we know which we're doing!

## Homogeneity test hypotheses	{#section5-2}

If we define some additional notation, we can then define hypotheses that allow us
to assess evidence related to whether the treatment "matters" in Homogeneity
situations.
\index{Chi-Square Test!Homogeneity Test}
This situation is similar to what we did in the One-Way ANOVA (Chapter \@ref(chapter3))
situation with quantitative responses but the parameters now
relate to proportions in the response variable categories across the groups. 
First we can define the conditional population proportions in level $c$ (column 
$c=1,\ldots,C$) of group $r$ (row $r=1,\ldots,R$) as $p_{rc}$. 
Table \@ref(tab:Table5-2) shows the proportions, noting that the proportions 
in each row sum to 1 since they are conditional on the group of
interest. A ***transposed*** (rows and columns flipped) version of this table is
produced by the ``tally`` function if you use the formula ``~y|x``.
\index{\texttt{tally()}}

Table: (\#tab:Table5-2) (ref:tab5-2)

In the Homogeneity situation, the null hypothesis is that the distributions are the same in all
the $R$ populations.
\index{Chi-Square Test!Homogeneity Test}
This means that the null hypothesis is:

\newpage

$$\begin{array}{rl}
\mathbf{H_0:}\  & \mathbf{p_{11}=p_{21}=\ldots=p_{R1}} \textbf{ and } \mathbf{p_{12}=p_{22}=\ldots=p_{R2}}  \textbf{ and } \mathbf{p_{13}=p_{23}=\ldots=p_{R3}} \\ 
& \textbf{ and } \mathbf{\ldots} \textbf{ and }\mathbf{p_{1C}=p_{2C}=\ldots=p_{RC}}. \\
\end{array}$$

<!-- \newpage -->

If all the groups are the same, then they all have the same conditional proportions and we can 
more simply write the null hypothesis as:

$$\mathbf{H_0:(p_{r1},p_{r2},\ldots,p_{rC})=(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_C)} \textbf{ for all } \mathbf{r}.$$

In other words, the pattern of proportions across the columns are **the same for all the**
$\mathbf{R}$ **groups**. The alternative is that there is some difference in the proportions 
of at least one
response category for at least one group. In slightly more gentle and easier to
reproduce words, equivalently, we can say:

* $\mathbf{H_0:}$ **The population distributions of the responses for variable** $\mathbf{y}$
**are the same across the** $\mathbf{R}$ **groups**.

The alternative hypothesis is then:

* $\mathbf{H_A:}$ **The population distributions of the responses for variable** $\mathbf{y}$
**are NOT ALL the same across the** $\mathbf{R}$ **groups**.

To make this concrete, consider what the proportions could look like if they satisfied 
the null hypothesis for the *Arthritis* example, as displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-4).

(ref:fig5-4) Plot of one way that the Arthritis proportions could have been if the null hypothesis had been true.

![(\#fig:Figure5-4)(ref:fig5-4)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-4-1.pdf) 

\indent Note that the proportions in the different response categories do not need to be the 
same just that the distribution needs
to be the same across the groups. The null hypothesis does *not*
require that all three response categories (*none*, *some*, *marked*) be equally 
likely. It assumes
that whatever the distribution of proportions is across these three levels of the response that
there is no difference in that distribution between the explanatory variable
(here treated/placebo) groups. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-4) shows an example of a 
situation where
the null hypothesis is true and the distributions of responses across the
groups look the same but the proportions for *none*, *some* and *marked* are 
not all equally likely. That
situation satisfies the null hypothesis. Compare this plot to the one for the
real data set in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-2). It looks like there might be 
some differences in
the responses between the treated and placebo groups as that plot looks much
different from this one, but we will need a test statistic and a p-value to
fully address the evidence relative to the previous null hypothesis. 

## Independence test hypotheses	{#section5-3}

When we take a single random sample of size $N$ and make a contingency 
table, our inferences relate to whether there is a relationship or
***association*** (that they are not independent) between the variables.
This is related to whether the distributions of proportions match
across rows in the table but is a more general question since we do not 
need to determine a variable to condition on, one that takes on the role 
of an explanatory variable, from the two variables of interest. In general,
the hypotheses for an Independence test for variables $x$ and $y$ are:
\index{Chi-Square Test!Independence Test}

* $\mathbf{H_0}$: **There is no relationship between** $\mathbf{x}$ **and**
$\mathbf{y}$ **in the population.** 

    * Or: $H_0$: $x$ and $y$ are independent in the population. 

* $\mathbf{H_A}$: **There is a relationship between** $\mathbf{x}$ **and** 
$\mathbf{y}$ **in the population.**

    * Or: $H_A$: $x$ and $y$ are dependent in the population. 

\indent To illustrate a test of independence, consider an example involving 
data from a national random sample
taken prior to the 2000 U.S. elections from the data set ``election``
from the package ``poLCA`` (@R-poLCA, @Linzer2011). Each respondent's
democratic-republican partisan identification was collected, 
provided in the ``PARTY`` variable for measurements on a seven-point 
scale from (1) *Strong Democrat*, (2) *Weak Democrat*, 
(3) *Independent-Democrat*, (4) *Independent-Independent*, 
(5) *Independent-Republican*, (6) *Weak Republican*, to 
(7) *Strong Republican*. The ``VOTEF`` variable that is created below 
will contain the candidate that the participants voted for (the data set was
originally coded with 1, 2, and 3 for the candidates and we replaced those
``levels`` \index{\texttt{levels}} with the candidate names). The contingency table shows some expected
results, that individuals with strong party affiliations tend to vote for the
party nominee with strong support for Gore in the democrats 
(``PARTY`` = 1 and 2) and strong support for Bush in the republicans
(``PARTY`` = 6 and 7). As always, we want to support our explorations with
statistical inferences, here with the potential to extend inferences to 
the overall population of
voters. The inferences in an independence test are related to whether there is a
relationship between the two variables in the population.
\index{Chi-Square Test!Independence Test}
A ***relationship*** between variables occurs when knowing the level of 
one variable for a person, 
say that they voted for Gore, informs the types of responses that you would
expect for that person, here that they are likely affiliated with the Democratic
Party. When there is no relationship (the null hypothesis here), knowing the
level of one variable is not informative about the level of the other variable.

The hypotheses for an Independence/Association Test here are: 

* $H_0$: There is no relationship between party affiliation and voting 
status in the population. 

    * Or: $H_0$: Party affiliation and voting status are independent in the
    population. 

* $H_A$: There is a relationship between party affiliation and voting 
status in the population. 

    * Or: $H_A$: Party affiliation and voting status are dependent in the
    population. 

You could also write these hypotheses with the variables switched and 
that is also perfectly acceptable. Because
these hypotheses are ambivalent about the choice of a variable as an "x" or a
"y", the summaries of results should be consistent with that idea. We should
not calculate conditional proportions or make stacked bar charts since they
imply a directional relationship from x to y (or results for y conditional on
the levels of x) that might be hard to justify. Our summaries in these
situations are the contingency table (``tally(~var1+var2, data=DATASETNAME)``)
and a new graph called a ***mosaic plot*** (using the ``mosaicplot`` 
function). 
\index{\texttt{mosaicplot()}}

\indent Mosaic plots display a box for each cell count whose area corresponds 
to the proportion of the *total* data set that is in that cell 
$(n_{rc}/\mathbf{N})$. In some cases, the bars can be short or narrow 
if proportions of the total are small and the labels can be
hard to read but the same bars or a single line exist for each category of the
variables in all rows and columns. The mosaic plot makes it easy to identify
the most common combination of categories. For example, in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-5) the *Gore* and ``PARTY`` = 1 (*Strong Democrat*)
box in the top segment under column 1 of the plot has the largest area 
so is the highest proportion of the total. Similarly, the middle segment 
on the right for the ``PARTY`` category 7s corresponds to the *Bush* 
voters who were a 7 (*Strong Republican*). Knowing that the
middle box in each column is for Bush voters is a little difficult as "Other"
and "Bush" overlap each other in the y-axis labeling but it is easy enough to
sort out the story here if we have briefly explored the contingency table. We
can also get information about the variable used to make the 
columns as the width
of the columns is proportional to the number of subjects in each 
``PARTY`` category in this plot. There were relatively few 4s 
(*Independent-Independent* responses) in total in the data set. 
Also, the *Other* category was the highest proportion of any 
vote-getter in the
``PARTY`` = 4 column but there were actually slightly more 
*Other* votes out of the total in the 3s (*Independent-Democrat*) 
party affiliation. Comparing the size of the 4s & *Other* segment 
with the 3s & *Other* segment, one should conclude that the 3s & *Other*
segment is a slightly larger portion of the total data set. There is 
generally a gradient of decreasing/increasing voting rates for the 
two main party candidates
across the party affiliations, but there are a few exceptions. For 
example, the
proportion of *Gore* voters goes up slightly between the ``PARTY`` 
affiliations of 5s and 6s -- as the voters become more strongly republican. To
have evidence of a relationship, there just needs to be a pattern of variation
across the plot of some sort but it does not need to follow such an easily
described pattern, especially when the categorical variables do not contain
natural ordering. 

\indent The mosaic plots are best made on the tables created by the ``tally`` 
function from a table that just contains the counts (**no totals**): 
\index{\texttt{tally()}}

# the total in the table

```

![(\#fig:Figure5-5)(ref:fig5-5)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-5-1.pdf) 

\indent In general, the results here are not too surprising as the respondents 
became more heavily republican, 
they voted for Bush and the same pattern occurs as you look at more democratic
respondents. As the voters leaned towards being independent, the proportion
voting for "Other" increased. So it certainly seems that there is some sort of
relationship between party affiliation and voting status. As always, it is good
to compare the observed results to what we would expect if the null hypothesis
is true. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-6) assumes that the null 
hypothesis is true and shows the variation
in the proportions in each category in the columns and variation in the
proportions across the rows, but displays no relationship between 
``PARTY`` and ``VOTEF``. Essentially, the pattern down a 
column is the same for all
the columns or vice-versa for the rows. The way to think of "no relationship"
here would involve considering whether knowing the party level could help you
predict the voting response and that is not the case in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-6) but was in certain places in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-5).

## Models for R by C tables	{#section5-4}

This section is very short in this chapter because we really do not use any 
"models" in this Chapter. There are some complicated
statistical models that can be employed in these situations, but they are
beyond the scope of this book. What we do have in this situation is our
original data summary in the form of a contingency table, graphs of the results
like those seen above, a hypothesis test and p-value (presented below), and
some post-test plots that we can use to understand the "source" of any evidence
we found in the test. 

## Permutation tests for the $X^2$ statistic	{#section5-5}

In order to assess the evidence against our null hypotheses of 
no difference in distributions or no
relationship between the variables, we need to define a test 
statistic and find
its distribution under the null hypothesis. The test statistic 
used with both
types of tests is called the  $\mathbf{X^2}$ ***statistic***
(we want to call the statistic X-square not Chi-square). The statistic 
compares the
observed counts in the contingency table to the ***expected counts*** 
under the null hypothesis, with large differences between what 
we observed and what we
expect under the null leading to evidence against the null hypothesis. To help
this statistic to follow a named parametric distribution and provide some
insights into sources of interesting differences from the null hypothesis, we  ***standardize***^[Standardizing involves dividing by the standard deviation 
of a quantity so it has a standard deviation 1 regardless of its original
variability and that is what is happening here even though it doesn't 
look like the standardization you are used to with continuous variables.]
the difference between the observed and expected counts by the square-root of
the expected count.
\index{parametric} \index{Chi-square test} 
The  $\mathbf{X^2}$ ***statistic*** is based on
the sum of squared standardized differences, 

$$\boldsymbol{X^2 = \Sigma^{RC}_{i=1}\left(\frac{Observed_i-Expected_i}
{\sqrt{Expected_i}}\right)^2},$$

which is the sum over all ($R$ times $C$) cells in the contingency 
table of the square of the difference between observed and expected 
cell counts divided by the square root of the
expected cell count. To calculate this test statistic, it useful to start with
a table of expected cell counts to go with our contingency table of observed
counts. \index{expected cell count} The expected cell counts are easiest to understand in the 
homogeneity situation but are calculated the same in either scenario. 

\indent The idea underlying finding the ***expected cell counts*** is to find 
how many observations we would expect in category $c$ given the sample
size in that group, $\mathbf{n_{r\bullet}}$, if the null hypothesis is true.
Under the null hypothesis across all $R$ groups 
the conditional probabilities in each response category must be the
same. Consider Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-7) where, under the null 
hypothesis, the probability of *None*, *Some*, and *Marked* are the same
in both treatment groups. Specifically we have $\text{Pr}(None)=0.5$, 
$\text{Pr}(Some)=0.167$, and $\text{Pr}(Marked)=0.333$. With 
$\mathbf{n_{Placebo\bullet}}=43$ and $\text{Pr}(None)=0.50$, we would
expect $43*0.50=21.5$ subjects to be found in the *Placebo, None*
combination if the null hypothesis were true. Similarly, with
$\text{Pr}(Some)=0.167$, we would expect $43*0.167=7.18$ in the 
*Placebo, Some* cell. And for the *Treated* group with 
$\mathbf{n_{Treated\bullet}}=41$, the expected count in the *Marked* 
improvement group would be $41*0.333=13.65$. Those conditional
probabilities came from aggregating across the rows because, under the null, 
the row (*Treatment*) should not matter. So, the conditional 
probability was actually calculated as $\mathbf{n_{\bullet c}/N}$ = 
total number of responses in category $c$ divided by the table total. Since each
expected cell count was a conditional probability times the number of
observations in the row, we can re-write the expected cell count formula for
row $r$ and column $c$ as:

$$\mathbf{Expected\ cell\ count_{rc} = \frac{(n_{r\bullet}*n_{\bullet c})}{N}} = 
\frac{(\text{row } r \text{ total }*\text{ column } c \text{ total})}
{\text{table total}}.$$

Table \@ref(tab:Table5-3) demonstrates the calculations of the 
expected cell counts using this formula for all 6 cells in the $2\times 3$
table.

\indent Of course, using R can help us avoid tedium like this... The main 
engine for results in this chapter is the ``chisq.test``
function. \index{\texttt{chisq.test()}} It operates on a table of
counts that has been produced **without row or column totals**. 

<!-- \newpage -->

\indent For example, ``Arthtable`` below contains just the observed cell 
counts. Applying the ``chisq.test`` function^[Note that in smaller data sets to get results as discussed here, use the ``correct=F`` option. If you get output that contains "``...with Yate's continuity correction``", a slightly modified version of this test is being used.] to ``Arthtable``
provides a variety of useful output. For the moment, we are just 
going to extract the information in the "``expected``" attribute of 
the results from running this function (using ``chisq.test(TABLENAME)$expected)``.
These are the expected cell counts which match the previous calculations 
except for some rounding in the hand-calculations. 

<!-- \newpage -->

```

\indent With the observed and expected cell counts in hand, we can turn our 
attention to calculating the test
statistic. It is possible to lay out the "contributions" to the 
$X^2$ statistic in a table format, allowing a simple way to finally 
calculate the statistic without losing any information. For  **each cell**
we need to find 

$$(\text{observed}-\text{expected})/\sqrt{\text{expected}}),$$

**square them**, and then we need to add them **all** up. In the 
current example, there are 6 cells to add up ($R=2$ times $C=3$), shown 
in Table \@ref(tab:Table5-4).

Finally, the $X^2$ statistic here is the sum of these six results 
$={\color{red}{2.616+0.004+3.752+2.744+0.004+3.935}}=13.055$ 

\indent Our favorite function in this chapter, ``chisq.test``, does not provide 
the contributions to the $X^2$ statistic directly. It provides a related 
quantity called the \index{Chi-square test!standardized residual}

$$\textbf{standardized residual}=\left(\frac{\text{Observed}_i -
\text{Expected}_i}{\sqrt{\text{Expected}_i}}\right),$$

which, when squared (in R, squaring is accomplished using ``^2``),
is the contribution of that particular cell to the $X^2$
statistic that is displayed in Table \@ref(tab:Table5-4). 

<!-- \newpage -->


```r

##   Treated 2.743902439 0.004065041 3.934959350
```

The most common error made in calculating the $X^2$ statistic by hand 
involves having observed less than expected
and then failing to make the $X^2$ contribution positive for all cells
(remember you are  **squaring the entire quantity** in the parentheses
and so the sign has to go positive!). In R, we can add up the cells using 
the ``sum`` function over the entire table of numbers:



```r
sum((chisq.test(Arthtable)$residuals)^2)
```

```
## [1] 13.05502
```

Or we can let R do all this hard work for us and get straight to the 
good stuff:


```r
chisq.test(Arthtable)
```

```
## 
## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test
## 
## data:  Arthtable
## X-squared = 13.055, df = 2, p-value = 0.001463
```

\indent The ``chisq.test`` \index{\texttt{chisq.test()}} function reports a p-value by
default. Before we discover how it got that result, we can rely on our
permutation methods to obtain a distribution for the $X^2$ statistic
under the null hypothesis. As in Chapters \@ref(chapter2) and \@ref(chapter3),
this will allow us to find a
p-value while relaxing one of our assumptions^[Here it allows us to relax 
a requirement that all the expected cell counts are larger than 5 for the
parametric test (Section \@ref(section5-6)).]. 
In the One-WAY ANOVA in Chapter \@ref(chapter3), we permuted the 
grouping variable relative
to the responses, mimicking the null hypothesis that the groups are the same
and so we can shuffle them around if the null is true. That same technique is
useful here. If we randomly permute the grouping variable used to form the rows
in the contingency table relative to the responses in the other variable and
track the possibilities available for the $X^2$ statistic under
permutations, we can find the probability of getting a result as extreme as or
more extreme than what we observed assuming the null is true, our p-value.
\index{p-value!permutation distribution}
The observed statistic is the
$X^2$ calculated using the formula above.
\index{permutation}
Like the $F$-statistic, it ends up
that only results in the right tail of this distribution are desirable for 
finding evidence against the null hypothesis
because all the values showing deviation from the null in any direction going into the statistic have to be positive. You can see this by observing that
values of the $X^2$ statistic close to 0 are generated when the
observed values are close to the expected values and that sort of result should
not be used to find evidence against the null. When the observed and expected
values are "far apart", then we should find evidence against the null. It is
helpful to work through some examples to be able to understand how the $X^2$
statistic "measures" differences between observed and expected.

![(\#fig:Figure5-8)(ref:fig5-8)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-8-1.pdf) 

\indent To start, compare the previous observed $X^2$ of 13.055 to the sort of 
results we obtain in a single permutation of the treated/placebo labels 
-- Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-8) (top left panel) shows
a permuted data set that produced $X^{2*} = 0.62$. Visually, you can only
see minimal differences between the treatment and placebo groups showing up in
the stacked bar chart. Three other permuted data sets are displayed in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-8) showing the variability in results in 
permutations but that none get close
to showing the differences in the bars observed in the real data set in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-2).

Arthperm <- Arthritis
Arthperm$PermTreatment <- factor(shuffle(Arthperm$Treatment))
```

## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test
## 
## data:  Arthpermtable
## X-squared = 0.47646, df = 2, p-value = 0.788
```

\indent To build the permutation-based null distribution for the $X^2$ statistic, 
we need to collect up the test statistics ($X^{2*}$) in many of these permuted
results. The code is similar to permutation tests in Chapters 
\@ref(chapter2) and \@ref(chapter3) except
that each permutation generates a new contingency table that is summarized and
provided to ``chisq.test `` to analyze. We extract the

For an observed $X^2$ statistic of 13.055, two out of 1,000 permutation
results matched or exceeded this value (``pdata`` returned a value of 
0.002) as displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-9). 
\index{\texttt{pdata()}}
This suggests that our observed result is quite extreme 
relative to the null
hypothesis and provides strong evidence against it. 
\index{permutation!test}

<!-- \newpage -->

**Validity conditions** for a permutation $X^2$ test are:
\index{validity conditions!@$X^2$ test!permutation}

1. Independence of observations. 
\index{independence assumption!Chi-square test}

2. Both variables are categorical. 

3. Expected cell counts > 0 (otherwise $X^2$ is not defined). 

For the permutation approach described here to provide valid inferences
we need to be working with
observations that are independent of one another. One way that a violation of
independence can sometimes occur in this situation is when a single subject
shows up in the table more than once. For example, if a single individual
completes a survey more than once and those results are reported as if they
came from $N$ independent individuals. 
Be careful about this as it is really easy to make tables of poorly collected
or non-independent observations and then consider them for these analyses. Poor
data still lead to poor conclusions even if you have fancy new statistical
tools to use!

## Chi-square distribution for the $X^2$ statistic	{#section5-6}

When one additional assumption beyond the previous assumptions for 
the permutation
test is met, it is possible to avoid permutations to find the distribution of
the $X^2$ statistic under the null hypothesis and get a p-value using
what is called the ***Chi-square or*** $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-**distribution**.
\index{Chi-Square distribution}
The name of our test statistic, X-squared, is meant to allude to the
potential that this will follow a $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution 
in certain situations but may not do that all the time and we still 
can use the methods in Section \@ref(section5-5). Along with the 
previous assumption
regarding independence and all expected cell counts are greater than 0, we make a
requirement that ***N*** (the total sample size) is "large enough" and 
this assumption is written in terms of the expected cell counts. 
If ***N*** is large, then all the expected cell counts should also be 
large because all those observations have
to go somewhere. The problems for the $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution 
as an approximation to the distribution
of the $X^2$ statistic under the null hypothesis come when expected
cell counts are below 5. And the smaller the expected cell counts become, the
more problematic the $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution is as an 
approximation of the sampling distribution of the $X^2$ statistic under 
the null hypothesis. **The standard rule of thumb is that all the expected
cell counts need to exceed 5 for the parametric approach to be valid**.
\index{validity conditions!@$X^2$ test!parametric}
When 
this condition is violated, it is better to use the permutation approach. 
The ``chisq.test`` function will provide a warning message 
to help you notice this. But it is good practice to always explore
the expected cell counts using ``chisq.test(...)$expected``. 


```r
chisq.test(Arthtable)$expected
```

```
##          Improved
## Treatment None     Some   Marked
##   Placebo 21.5 7.166667 14.33333
##   Treated 20.5 6.833333 13.66667
```

In the Arthritis data set, the sample size was sufficiently large for
the $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution to provide an accurate p-value 
since the smallest expected cell count is 6.833 (so all expected counts are larger than 5). 

(ref:fig5-10) $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution with two degrees of freedom with the observed statistic of 13.1 indicated with a vertical line. 

![(\#fig:Figure5-10)(ref:fig5-10)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-10-1.pdf) 

\indent The $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution is a right-skewed distribution 
that starts at 0 as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-10). Its shape
changes as a function of its degrees of freedom. In the contingency 
table analyses, the ***degrees of freedom*** for the Chi-square test 
are calculated as \index{Chi-Square Test} 
\index{degrees of freedom!Chi-Square test}

$$\textbf{DF} \mathbf{=(R-1)*(C-1)} = (\text{number of rows }-1)*
(\text{number of columns }-1).$$

In the $2 \times 3$ table above, the $\text{DF}=(2-1)*(3-1)=2$ leading 
to a Chi-square
distribution with 2 *df* for the distribution of $X^2$ under the null 
hypothesis. The p-value is based on the area to the right of the observed 
$X^2$ value of 13.055 and the ``pchisq`` function provides that area as
0.00146. 
\index{p-value}
\index{\texttt{pchisq()}}
Note that this is very similar to the permutation result found
previously for these data. 


```r
pchisq(13.055, df=2, lower.tail=F)
```

```
## [1] 0.001462658
```

We'll see more examples of the $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distributions
in each of the examples that follow. 



\indent A small side note about sample sizes is warranted here. In 
contingency tables, especially those based
on survey data, it is common to have large overall sample sizes ($N$). 
With large sample sizes, it becomes easy to find strong evidence against the null hypothesis, even when the "distance" from the null
is relatively minor and possibly unimportant. By this we mean that the observed proportions are a small practical distance
from the situation described in the null. After obtaining a small p-value, we
need to consider whether we have obtained ***practical significance***
(or maybe better described as ***practical importance***) to 
accompany our discussion 
of strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Whether a result is large enough to
be of practical
importance can only be judged by knowing something about the situation we are
studying and by providing a good summary of our results to allow experts to
assess the size and importance of the result.  Unfortunately, many
researchers are so happy to see small p-values that this is their last step. We encountered a similar situation in the car overtake distance data set where a large sample size provided a data set that had a small p-value and possibly minor differences in the means driving it.   

\indent If we revisit our observed results, re-plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-11)
since it was quite a ways back that we saw the original data in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-2), knowing that we have strong evidence against the null hypothesis 
of no difference between *Placebo* and *Treated* groups, what can we 
say about the effectiveness of the arthritis medication? It seems that there is a real and important increase in the proportion 
of patients getting improvement (*Some* or *Marked*). If the differences 
"looked" smaller, even with a small p-value you^[Doctors are faced with this exact dilemma -- with little more training than you have now in statistics, they read a result like this in a paper and used to be encouraged to focus on the p-value to decide about treatment recommendations. Would you recommend the treatment here just based on the small p-value? Would having Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-11) to go with the small p-value help you make a more educated decision? Recommendations for users of statistical results are starting to move past just focusing on the p-values and thinking about the practical importance and size of the differences. The potential benefits of a treatment need to be balanced with risks of complications too, but that takes us back into discussing having multiple analyses in the same study (treatment improvement, complications/not, etc.).] might not recommend someone take the drug...

## Examining residuals for the source of differences	{#section5-7}

Small p-values are generated by large $X^2$ values. If we want to understand
the source of a small p-value, we need to understand what made the test
statistic large. To get a large $X^2$ value, we either need many small
contributions from lots of cells or a few large contributions. In most
situations, there are just a few cells that show large deviations between the
null hypothesis (expected cell counts) and what was observed (observed cell
counts). It is possible to explore the "size" and direction of the differences
between observed and expected counts to learn something about the behavior of
the relationship between the variables, especially as it relates to evidence
against the null hypothesis of no difference or no relationship. The  ***standardized residual***, 

$$\boldsymbol{\left(\frac{\textbf{Observed}_i - 
\textbf{Expected}_i}{\sqrt{\textbf{Expected}_i}}\right)},$$

provides a measure of deviation of the observed from expected which 
retains the **direction of deviation** (whether observed was
**more or less than expected** is interesting for interpretations) for
each cell in the table. It is scaled much like a standard normal distribution
providing a scale for "large" deviations for absolute values that are over 2 or
3. In other words, values with magnitude over 2 should be your focus in the
standardized residuals, noting whether the observed counts were much more or
less than expected. On the $X^2$ scale, standardized residuals of 2 or
more mean that the cells are contributing 4 or more units to the overall
statistic, which is a pretty noticeable bump up in the size of the statistic. A
few contributions at 4 or higher and you will likely end up with a small
p-value. 
\index{residuals}

\indent There are two ways to explore standardized residuals. First, we can 
obtain them via the ``chisq.test`` and manually identify the "big
ones". Second, we can augment a mosaic plot of the table with the 
standardized results by turning on the ``shade=T`` option and have 
the plot help us find the big differences. This technique can be 
applied whether we are performing an Independence or
Homogeneity test -- both are evaluated with the same $X^2$ statistic so
the large standardized residuals are of interest in both situations. Both types
of results are shown for the Arthritis data table:

(ref:fig5-12) Mosaic plot of the Arthritis data with large standardized residuals indicated (actually, there were none that were indicated because all were less than 2). Note that dashed borders correspond to negative standardized residuals (observed less than expected) and solid borders are positive standardized residuals (observed more than expected).


```

## Treatment        None        Some      Marked
##   Placebo  1.61749160 -0.06225728 -1.93699199
##   Treated -1.65647289  0.06375767  1.98367320
```

```r
chisq.test(Arthtable)$residuals
mosaicplot(Arthtable, shade=T)
```

\indent In these data, the standardized residuals are all less than 2 in 
magnitude so Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-12) isn't
too helpful but this type of plot is in other examples. The largest
contributions to the $X^2$ statistic come from the *Placebo* and *Treated*
groups in the *Marked* improvement cells. Those standardized residuals 
are -1.94 and 1.98 (both really close to 2), showing that the *placebo* 
group had  **noticeably fewer** *Marked* improvement 
**results than expected** and the *Treated* group **had noticeably more**
*Marked* improvement responses **than expected if the null hypothesis was true**. Similarly but with smaller magnitudes, there were more *None*
results than expected in the *Placebo* group and fewer *None* results 
than expected in the *Treated* group. The standardized residuals were 
very small in the two cells for the *Some* improvement category, showing 
that the treatment/placebo were similar in this response category and 
that the results
were about what would be expected if the null hypothesis of no difference 
were true. 

## General protocol for $X^2$ tests	{#section5-8}

In any contingency table situation, there is a general protocol to 
completing an analysis. 

1. Identify the data collection method and whether the proper analysis 
is based on the Independence or Homogeneity hypotheses 
(Section \@ref(section5-1)).

2. Make contingency table and get a general sense of response patterns.
Pay attention to "small" counts, especially cells with 0 counts. 

    a. If there are many small count cells, consider combining categories 
    on one or both variables to make a new variable with fewer categories 
    that has larger counts per cell to have more robust inferences (see 
    Section \@ref(section5-10) for a related example).
    
3. Make the appropriate graphical display of results and generally 
describe the pattern of responses.

    a. For Homogeneity, make a stacked bar chart.
    
    b. For Independence, make a mosaic plot.
    
    c. Consider a more general exploration using a tableplot if other 
    variables were measured to check for confounding and other interesting multi-variable relationships. Also check for missing data if you have not done this before.
    
4. Conduct the 6+ steps of the appropriate type of hypothesis test.

    a. Use permutations if any expected cell counts are below 5. 
    
    b. If all expected cell counts greater than 5, either permutation or parametric 
    approaches are acceptable.
    
    \newpage
    
5. Explore the standardized residuals for the "source" of any evidence 
against the null -- this can be the start of your "size" discussion. 

    a. Tie the interpretation of the "large" standardized residuals 
    and their direction (above or below expected under the
    null) back into the original data display (this really gets to "size"). Work to find a story 
    for the pattern of responses. If little evidence is found against the null, there is not much to do here.

## Political party and voting results: Complete analysis	{#section5-9}

As introduced in Section \@ref(section5-3), a national random sample 
of voters was obtained
related to the 2000 Presidential Election with the party affiliations and
voting results recorded for each subject. The data are available in 
``election`` in the ``poLCA`` package [@R-poLCA]. It
is always good to start with a bit of data exploration with a tableplot, 
displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-13).
\index{tableplot}
Many of the lines of code here 
are just for making
sure that R is treating the categorical variables that were coded numerically
as categorical variables. 

(ref:fig5-13) Tableplot of vote, party affiliation, education, and gender from election survey data. Note that missing observations are present in all variables except for ``Gender``. Education is coded from 1 to 7 with higher values related to higher educational attainment. ``Gender`` code 1 is for male and 2 is for female.


```r
election$VOTEF <- factor(election$VOTE3)
election$PARTY <- factor(election$PARTY)
election$EDUC <- factor(election$EDUC)
election$GENDER <- factor(election$GENDER)
levels(election$VOTEF) <- c("Gore","Bush","Other")
# Required options to avoid error when running on a PC, 
# should have no impact on other platforms
options(ffbatchbytes = 1024^2 * 128); options(ffmaxbytes = 1024^2 * 128 * 32) 
tableplot(election, select=c(VOTEF,PARTY,EDUC,GENDER),pals=list("BrBG"), sample=F)
```

![(\#fig:Figure5-13)(ref:fig5-13)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-13-1.pdf) 

In Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-13), we can see many missing ``VOTEF``
responses but also some missingness in ``PARTY`` and ``EDUC`` 
(*Education*) status. While we don't know
too much about why people didn't respond on the Vote question -- they could have
been unwilling to answer it or may not have voted. It looks like those subjects
have more of the lower education level responses (more dark colors, especially level 2 of education) than in the responders to this question. There are many "middle" ratings
 in the party affiliation responses for the missing ``VOTEF`` responses, 
suggesting that independents were less likely to answer the question in the
survey for whatever reason. Even though this comes with concerns about who these results actually apply to (likely not the population that was sampled from), we want to focus on those that did respond in 
``VOTEF``, so will again use ``na.omit`` to clean out any subjects with any
missing responses on these four variables and remake this plot 
(Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-14)). The code also adds the ``sort`` option to the
``tableplot`` function call that provides an easy way to sort the data set 
based on other variables.
\index{\texttt{tableplot()}}
It is interesting, for example, to sort the
responses by *Education* level and explore the differences in other variables.
These explorations are omitted here but easily available by changing the
sorting column from 1 to ``sort=3`` or ``sort=EDUC``. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-14) shows us that there are clear differences
in party affiliation based on voting for *Bush*, *Gore*, or
*Other*. It is harder to see if there are differences in education level or gender
based on the voting status in this plot, but, as noted above, sorting on these
other variables can sometimes help to see other relationships between
variables. 

(ref:fig5-14) Tableplot of election data with subjects without any missing responses (complete cases).


```r
election2 <- na.omit(election[,c("VOTEF","PARTY","EDUC","GENDER")])
tableplot(election2, select=c(VOTEF,PARTY,EDUC,GENDER), sort=1, pals=list("BrBG"), 
          sample=F)
```

![(\#fig:Figure5-14)(ref:fig5-14)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-14-1.pdf) 
 

\indent Focusing on the party affiliation and voting results, the appropriate 
analysis is with
an Independence test because a single random sample was obtained from the population. 
The total sample size for the complete responses was $N=$ 1,149 
(out of the original 1,785 subjects). Because this is an Independence test,
the mosaic plot is the appropriate display of the results, 
which was provided in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-5).

```

\indent There is a potential for bias in some polls because of the methods used 
to find and contact people. As
U.S. residents have transitioned from land-lines to cell phones, the early
adopting cell phone users were often excluded from political polling. These
policies are being reconsidered to adapt to the decline in residential phone
lines and most polling organizations now include cell phone numbers in their
list of potential respondents. This study may have some bias regarding who was
considered as part of the population of interest and who was actually found
that was willing to respond to their questions. We don't have much information
here but biases arising from unobtainable members of populations are a potential
issue in many studies, especially when questions tend toward more sensitive
topics. We can make inferences here to people that were willing to respond to
the request to answer the survey but should be cautious in extending it to all
Americans or even voters in the year 2000. When we say "population" below, this
nuanced discussion is what we mean. Because the political party is not randomly
assigned to the subjects, we cannot make causal inferences for political
affiliation causing different voting patterns^[Independence tests can't
be causal by their construction. Homogeneity tests could be causal or just
associational, depending on how the subjects ended up in the groups.].

<!-- \newpage -->

Here are our 6+ steps applied to this example:

0. The desired RQ is about assessing the relationship between part affiliation and vote choice, but this is constrained by the large rate of non-response in this data set. This is an Independence test and so the tableplot and mosaic plot are good visualizations to consider and the $X^2$-statistic will be used.

1. **Hypotheses:**

    * $H_0$: There is no relationship between the party affiliation 
    (7 levels) and voting results (*Bush*, *Gore*, *Other*) in the 
    population.
    
    * $H_A$: There is a relationship between the party affiliation 
    (7 levels) and voting results (*Bush*, *Gore*, *Other*) in the 
    population. 
    
    

2. **Plot the data and assess validity conditions:** 
\index{validity conditions!Chi-square Test}

    * Independence:
    
        * There is no indication of an issue with this assumption since each subject is 
        measured only once in the table. No other information suggests 
        a potential issue since a random sample was taken from presumably 
        a large national population and we have no information that could suggest dependencies among observations.
        
    * All expected cell counts larger than 5 to use the parametric
    $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution to find p-values:
    
        * We need to generate a table of expected cell counts to be 
        able to check this condition:

        
        ```r
        chisq.test(electable)$expected
        ```
        
        ```
        ## Warning in chisq.test(electable): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
        ```
        
        ```
        ##      VOTEF
        ## PARTY      Gore      Bush    Other
        ##     1 124.81984 112.18799 8.992167
        ##     2  86.25762  77.52829 6.214099
        ##     3  79.66144  71.59965 5.738903
        ##     4  42.62141  38.30809 3.070496

        ##     7  97.42037  87.56136 7.018277
        ```
        
        * When we request the expected cell counts, R tries to help 
        us with a warning message if the expected cell counts might 
        be small, as in this situation.
        
        * There is one expected cell count below 5 for ``Party`` = 4
        who voted *Other* with an expected cell count of 3.07, so
        the condition is violated and the permutation approach
        should be used to obtain more trustworthy p-values. The 
        conditions are met for performing a permutation test.
        
    <!-- \newpage -->
    
3. **Calculate the test statistic and p-value:**

    * The test statistic is best calculated by the ``chisq.test`` function since there 
    are 21 cells and many potential places for a calculation error if 
    performed by hand.
    
    
    ```r
    chisq.test(electable)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## 
    ## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test
    ## 
    ## data:  electable
    ## X-squared = 762.81, df = 12, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ```
    
    * The observed $X^2$ statistic is 762.81.
    
    * The parametric p-value is < 2.2e-16 from the R output which 
    would be reported as < 0.0001. This was based on a
    $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution with $(7-1)*(3-1) = 12$
    degrees of freedom displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-15).
    Note that the observed test statistic of 762.81 was off the plot 
    to the right which reflects how little area is to the right of 
    that value in the distribution.
    
    ![(\#fig:Figure5-15)Plot of $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution with 12 degrees of freedom.](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-15-1.pdf) 

    * If you want to repeat this calculation directly you get a similarly 
    tiny value that R reports as 1.5e-155. Again, reporting less than 
    0.0001 is just fine.
    
    
    
    ```r
    pchisq(762.81, df=12, lower.tail=F)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 1.553744e-155
    ```

    * But since the expected cell count condition is violated, we should 
    use permutations as implemented in the following code to provide a more trustworthy p-value:

    
    ```r
    Tobs <- chisq.test(electable)$statistic; Tobs
    ```
    
    ```
    ## X-squared 
    ##  762.8095
    ```
    
    ```r
    par(mfrow=c(1,2))
    B <- 1000
    Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow=B)
    for (b in (1:B)){
      Tstar[b] <- chisq.test(tally(~shuffle(PARTY)+VOTEF, data=election2,
                                   margins=F))$statistic
    }
    pdata(Tstar, Tobs, lower.tail=F)[[1]]
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 0
    ```
    
    ```r
    hist(Tstar)

    plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar", lwd=2)

    * The last results tells us that there were no permuted data sets 
    that produced larger $X^2\text{'s}$ than the observed $X^2$ in 1,000
    permutations, so we report that the **p-value was less than 0.001**
    using the permutation approach. The permutation distribution in 
    Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-16) contains no results over 40, so the 
    observed configuration was really far from the null
    hypothesis of no relationship between party status and voting. 

<!-- \newpage -->

4. **Conclusion:**

    * There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no relationship between party affiliation and voting 
    results in the population ($X^2$=762.81, p-value<0.001), so we would conclude that there is a relationship between party affiliation and voting results.

5. **Size:**


    * We can add insight into the results by exploring the 
standardized residuals. The numerical results are obtained using ``chisq.test(electable)$residuals`` and visually using ``mosaicplot(electable, shade=T)`` in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-17). The standardized residuals show some clear sources of the differences from the results expected if there were no relationship present. The largest
contributions are found in the highest democrat category (``PARTY`` = 1)
where the standardized residual for *Gore* is 10.13 and for *Bush*
is -10.03, showing much higher than expected (under $H_0$) counts for Gore
voters and much lower than expected (under $H_0$) for Bush. 
Similar results in the opposite direction are found in the strong 
republicans (``PARTY`` = 7). Note how the brightest shade of blue in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-17) shows up for much higher than expected 
results and the brighter red for results in the other direction, 
where observed counts were
much lower than expected. When there are many large standardized residuals, it
is OK to focus on the largest results but remember that some of the
intermediate deviations, or lack thereof, could also be interesting. For
example, the Gore voters from ``PARTY`` = 3 had a standardized residual 
of 3.75 but the ``PARTY`` = 5 voters for Bush had a standardized residual
of 6.17. So maybe Gore didn't have
as strong of support from his center-leaning supporters as Bush was able to
obtain from the same voters on the other side of the middle? Exploring the relative proportion of each vertical bar in the response categories is also interesting to see the proportions of each level of party affiliation and how they voted. A political
scientist would easily obtain many more (useful) theories based on this combination of results.

## Is cheating and lying related in students?	{#section5-10}

A study of student behavior was performed at a university with a survey of 
$N=319$ undergraduate students (``cheating`` data set from the ``poLCA``
package originally published by @Dayton1998).
\index{R packages!\textbf{poLCA}}
They were asked to answer
four questions about their various
academic frauds that involved cheating and lying. Specifically, they were 
asked if they had ever lied to avoid taking an exam (``LIEEXAM`` with 1 
for no and 2 for yes), if they had lied to avoid handing in a term paper
on time (``LIEPAPER`` with 2 for yes), if they had purchased a term paper
to hand in as their own or obtained a copy of an exam prior to taking the
exam (``FRAUD`` with 2 for yes), and if they had copied answers during an
exam from someone near them (``COPYEXAM`` with 2 for yes). Additionally, 
their ``GPA``s were obtained and put into categories: (<2.99, 3.0 to 3.25,
3.26 to 3.50, 3.51 to 3.75, and 3.76 to 4.0). These categories were coded 
from 1 to 5, respectively. Again, the code starts with making sure the 
variables are treated categorically by applying the ``factor`` function. 
\index{\texttt{factor()}}

(ref:fig5-18) Tableplot of initial cheating and lying data set. Note that a few GPAs were missing in the data set.


```r
library(poLCA)
data(cheating) #Survey of students
cheating <- as_tibble(cheating)
cheating$LIEEXAM <- factor(cheating$LIEEXAM)
cheating$LIEPAPER <- factor(cheating$LIEPAPER)
cheating$FRAUD <- factor(cheating$FRAUD)
cheating$COPYEXAM <- factor(cheating$COPYEXAM)
cheating$GPA <- factor(cheating$GPA)
tableplot(cheating, sort=GPA,pals=list("BrBG"))
```

![(\#fig:Figure5-18)(ref:fig5-18)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-18-1.pdf) 

\indent We can explore some interesting questions about the relationships between 
these variables. The
tableplot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-18) again helps us to get a general 
idea of the data set
and to assess some complicated aspects of the relationships between variables. 
For example, the rates of different unethical behaviors seem to decrease with
higher GPA students (but do not completely disappear!). This data set also has
a few missing GPAs that we would want to carefully consider -- which sorts of
students might not be willing to reveal their GPAs? It ends up that these
students did not *admit* to any of the unethical behaviors... Note that we 
used the ``sort=GPA`` option in the ``tableplot`` function to sort the 
responses based on ``GPA`` to see how ``GPA`` might relate to patterns of 
unethical behavior. 

\indent While the relationship between GPA and presence/absence of the different 
behaviors is of interest, we want to explore the types of behaviors.
It is possible to group
the lying behaviors as being a different type (less extreme?) of unethical behavior than
obtaining an exam prior to taking it, buying a paper, or copying someone else's
answers. We want to explore whether there is some sort of relationship between
the lying and copying behaviors -- are those that engage in one type of behavior
more likely to do the other? Or are they independent of each other? This is a
hard story to elicit from the previous plot because there are so many variables
involved. 

(ref:fig5-19) Tableplot of new variables ``liar`` and ``copier`` that allow exploration of relationships between different types of lying and cheating behaviors.

![(\#fig:Figure5-19)(ref:fig5-19)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-19-1.pdf) 

\indent To simplify the results, combining the two groups of variables
into the four possible combinations on
each has the potential to simplify the results -- or at least allow exploration
of additional research questions. The ``interaction`` function is used to create two new variables that have four levels that are combinations of the different options from none to both of each type (*copier* and *liar*). In the tableplot in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-19), you can see
the four categories for each, starting with no bad behavior of either type
(which is fortunately the most popular response on both variables!). For each
variable, there are students who admitted to one of the two violations and some
that did both. The ``liar`` variable has categories of *None*, *ExamLie*,
*PaperLie*, and *LieBoth*. The ``copier`` variable has categories of *None*,
*PaperCheat*, *ExamCheat*, and *PaperExamCheat* (for doing both). The last 
category for ``copier`` seems to mostly occur at
the top of the plot which is where the students who had lied to get out of things
reside, so maybe there is a relationship between those two types of behaviors?
On the other hand, for the students who have never lied, quite a few had
cheated on exams. The contingency table can help us dig further into the
hypotheses related to the Chi-square test of Independence that is appropriate
in this situation. \index{Chi-Square Test!Independence Test}


```r
cheating$liar <- interaction(cheating$LIEEXAM, cheating$LIEPAPER)
levels(cheating$liar) <- c("None","ExamLie","PaperLie","LieBoth")

cheating$copier <- interaction(cheating$FRAUD, cheating$COPYEXAM)
levels(cheating$copier) <- c("None","PaperCheat","ExamCheat","PaperExamCheat")
tableplot(cheating, sort=liar, select=c(liar,copier),pals=list("BrBG"))
```

<!-- \newpage -->


```r
cheatlietable <- tally(~liar+copier, data=cheating)
cheatlietable
```

```
##           copier
## liar       None PaperCheat ExamCheat PaperExamCheat
##   None      207          7        46              5
##   ExamLie    10          1         3              2
##   PaperLie   13          1         4              2
##   LieBoth    11          1         4              2
```

\indent Unfortunately for our statistic, there were very few responses in some combinations of 
categories even with $N=319$. For example, there was only one response
each in the combinations for students that copied on papers and lied
to get out of exams, papers, and both. Some other categories were pretty small
as well in the groups that only had one behavior present. To get a higher
number of counts in the combinations, we combined the single behavior only levels
into "*either*" categories and left the *none* and *both* categories for each
variable. This creates two new variables called ``liar2`` and ``copier2``
(tableplot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-20)). The code to create these 
variables and make the plot is below which employs the ``levels`` function to assign the same label to two different levels from the original list. \index{\texttt{levels()}}


```r
#Collapse the middle categories of each variable
cheating$liar2 <- cheating$liar
levels(cheating$liar2) <- c("None","ExamorPaper","ExamorPaper","LieBoth")
cheating$copier2 <- cheating$copier
levels(cheating$copier2) <- c("None","ExamorPaper","ExamorPaper","CopyBoth")
cheatlietable <- tally(~liar2+copier2, data=cheating)

```

This $3\times 3$ table is more manageable and has few really small 
cells so we will proceed with the 6+ steps of hypothesis
testing applied to these data using the Independence testing methods (again a
single sample was taken from the population so that is the appropriate procedure to employ):

0. The RQ is about relationships between lying to instructors and cheating and these questions, after some work and simplifications, allow us to address a version of that RQ even though it might not be the one that we started with. The tableplots help to visualize the results and the $X^2$-statistic will be used to do the hypothesis test.

1. **Hypotheses:**

    * $H_0$: Lying and copying behavior are independent in the population
    of students at this university. 
    
    * $H_A$: Lying and copying behavior are dependent in the population
    of students at this university. 

2. **Validity conditions:**

    * Independence:
    
        * There is no indication of a violation of this assumption since each subject
        is measured only once in the table. No other information 
        suggests a potential issue but we don't have much 
        information on how these subjects were obtained. What happens if we had sampled from students in different sections of a multi-section course and one of the sections had recently had a cheating scandal that impacted many students in that section?
        
    * All expected cell counts larger than 5 (required to use
    $\chi^2$-distribution to find p-values):
    
        * We need to generate a table of expected cell counts to 
        check this condition:
        
        
        
        ```r
        chisq.test(cheatlietable)$expected
        ```
        
        ```
        ##              copier2
        ## liar2              None ExamorPaper  CopyBoth
        ##   None        200.20376   55.658307 9.1379310
        ##   ExamorPaper  27.19749    7.561129 1.2413793
        ##   LieBoth      13.59875    3.780564 0.6206897
        ```
    
        * When we request the expected cell counts, there is a 
        warning message (not shown).
        
        * There are three expected cell counts below 5, 
        so the condition is violated and a permutation approach 
        should be used to obtain more trustworthy p-values.

3. **Calculate the test statistic and p-value:**

    * Use ``chisq.test`` to obtain the test statistic, although this table is small enough to do 
    by hand if you want the practice -- see if you can find a similar answer
    to what the function provides:

    
    ```r
    chisq.test(cheatlietable)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## 
    ## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test
    ## 
    ## data:  cheatlietable
    ## X-squared = 13.238, df = 4, p-value = 0.01017
    ```

    * The $X^2$ statistic is 13.24.
    
    * The parametric p-value is 0.0102 from the R output. This was based
    on a $\chi^2$-distribution with $(3-1)*(3-1) = 4$ degrees of freedom 
    that is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-21). Remember that this 
    isn't quite the right distribution for the test statistic since our 
    expected cell count condition was violated.

    ![(\#fig:Figure5-21)Plot of $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution with 4 degrees of freedom.](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-21-1.pdf) 

    * If you want to repeat the p-value calculation directly:
    
    
    ```r
    pchisq(13.2384, df=4, lower.tail=F)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 0.01016781
    ```
    
    * But since the expected cell condition is violated, we 
    should use permutations as implemented in the following 
    code with the number of permutations increased to 10,000 to help 
    get a better estimate of the p-value since it is 
    possibly close to 0.05:

    
    ```r
    Tobs <- chisq.test(tally(~liar2+copier2, data=cheating))$statistic
    Tobs
    ```
    
    ```
    ## X-squared 
    ##  13.23844
    ```
    
    ```r
    par(mfrow=c(1,2))
    B <- 10000 # Now performing 10,000 permutations
    Tstar <- matrix(NA,nrow=B)
    for (b in (1:B)){
      Tstar[b] <- chisq.test(tally(~shuffle(liar2)+copier2,
                                   data=cheating))$statistic
    }
    pdata(Tstar, Tobs, lower.tail=F)[[1]]
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 0.0174
    ```
    
    ```r
    hist(Tstar)
    abline(v=Tobs, col="red", lwd=3)
    plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar", lwd=2)
    abline(v=Tobs, col="red", lwd=3)
    ```

    * There were 174 of $B$=10,000 permuted data 
    sets that produced as large or larger
    $X^{2*}\text{'s}$ than the observed as displayed in 
    Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-22), so we report that the p-value was 
    0.0174 using the permutation approach, which was slightly larger than the 
    result provided by the parametric method. 

4. **Conclusion:**

    * There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no relationship between lying and copying behavior in the population 
    of students ($X^2$-statistic=13.24, permutation p-value of 0.0174), so conclude that there is a relationship between lying and copying behavior at the university in the population of students studied. 
    
5. **Size:**
    
    * The standardized residuals can help us more fully understand this result -- the mosaic plot only had one cell shaded and so wasn't needed here. 
    
    
    ```r
    chisq.test(cheatlietable)$residuals
    ```
    
    ```
    ##              copier2
    ## liar2               None ExamorPaper   CopyBoth
    ##   None         0.4803220  -0.3563200 -1.3688609
    ##   ExamorPaper -0.8048695   0.5232734  2.4759378
    ##   LieBoth     -0.7047165   0.6271633  1.7507524
    ```

    * There is really only one large standardized residual for the *ExamorPaper* liars and the *CopyBoth* copiers, with a much larger observed value than expected of 2.48. The only other medium-sized standardized residuals came from the *CopyBoth* copiers column with fewer than expected students in the *None* category and more than expected in the *LieBoth* type of lying category. So we are seeing more than expected that lied somehow and copied -- we can say this suggests that the students who lie tend to copy too!
    

6. **Scope of inference:**

    * There is no causal inference possible here since 
    neither variable was randomly assigned (really neither is 
    explanatory or response here either) but we can extend the
    inferences to the population of students that these were selected 
    from that would be willing to reveal their GPA (see initial 
    discussion related to some differences in students that wouldn't
    answer that question). 

## Analyzing a stratified random sample of California schools	{#section5-11}

(ref:fig5-23) Pirate-plot of the API growth scores by level of school in the ``stype`` variable (coded E for elementary, M for Middle, and H for High school).

![(\#fig:Figure5-23)(ref:fig5-23)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-23-1.pdf) 

In recent decades, there has been a push for quantification of school performance
and tying financial punishment and rewards to growth in these metrics both for schools and for teachers. One
example is the API (Academic Performance Index) in California that is based
mainly on student scores on standardized tests. It ranges between 200 and 1000
and year to year changes are of interest to assess "performance" of schools --
calculated as one year minus the previous year (negative "growth" is also
possible!). Suppose that a researcher is interested in whether the growth
metric might differ between different levels of schools. Maybe it is easier or
harder for elementary, middle, or high schools to attain growth? The researcher
has a list of most of the schools in the state of each level that are using a
database that the researcher has access to. In order to assess this question, 
the researcher takes a ***stratified random sample***^[A stratified random sample
involves taking a simple random sample from each group or strata of the
population.
\index{random sampling}
It is useful to make sure that each group is represented at a 
chosen level (for example the sample proportion of the total
size). If a simple random sample of all schools had been taken, it is possible
that a level could have no schools selected.], selecting 
$n_{\text{elementary}}=100$ schools from the population of 4421 elementary 
schools, $n_{\text{middle}}=50$ from the population of 1018 middle schools,
and $n_{\text{high}}=50$ from the population of 755 high
schools. These data are available in the ``survey`` package [@R-survey]
and the ``api`` data object that loads both ``apipop`` (population) and ``apistrat`` (stratified random sample) data sets.
\index{R packages!\textbf{survey}}
The ``growth`` (change!) in 
API scores for the schools between 1999 and
2000 (taken as the year 2000 score minus 1999 score) is used as the response
variable. The pirate-plot of the growth scores are displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:Figure5-23). They suggest some differences in the growth 
rates among the different levels. There are also a few schools flagged as being possible outliers. 


```r

apistrat <- as_tibble(apistrat)
apipop <- as_tibble(apipop)

\indent The One-Way ANOVA $F$-test, provided below, suggests
strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference in the true mean growth scores among the different
types of schools ($F(2,197)=23.56,\text{ p-value}<0.0001$). But the 
residuals from this model displayed in the QQ-Plot in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-24) contain a slightly long right tail and short left tail, 
suggesting a right skewed
distribution for the residuals. In a high-stakes situation such as this, 
reporting results with violations of the assumptions probably would not be
desirable, so another approach is needed. The permutation methods would be
justified here but there is another "simpler" option available using our new 
Chi-square analysis methods.

\indent One way to get around the normality assumption is to use a method 
that does not assume the responses
follow a normal distribution. If we ***bin*** or cut the quantitative response
variable into a set of ordered categories and apply a Chi-square test, we can
proceed without concern about the lack of normality in the residuals of the
ANOVA model.
\index{residuals}
\index{Chi-Square Test} 
To create these bins, a simple idea would be to use the quartiles
to generate the response variable categories, binning the quantitative
responses into groups for the lowest 25%, second 25%, third 25%, and highest
25% by splitting the data at $Q_1$, the Median, and $Q_3$. In R, the 
``cut`` function is available to turn a
quantitative variable into a categorical variable. First, we can use the
information from ``favstats`` to find the cut-points:


```r
favstats(~growth, data=apistrat)
```

```
##  min   Q1 median Q3 max   mean      sd   n missing
##  -47 6.75     25 48 133 27.995 28.1174 200       0
```

The ``cut`` function can provide the binned variable if it is provided
with the end-points of the desired intervals to
create new categories with those names in a new variable called 
``growthcut``. \index{\texttt{cut()}}


```r
apistrat$growthcut <- cut(apistrat$growth, breaks=c(-47,6.75,25,48,133),
                          include.lowest=T)
```

\indent Now that we have a categorical response variable, we need to decide which 
sort of Chi-square
analysis to perform. The sampling design determines the correct analysis as
always in these situations. The stratified random sample involved samples from
each of the three populations so a Homogeneity test should be employed. In
these situations, the stacked bar chart provides the appropriate summary of the
data. It also shows us the labels of the categories that the ``cut`` function
created in the new ``growthcut`` variable:

(ref:fig5-25) Stacked bar chart of the growth category responses by level of school.

```r
plot(growthcut~stype, data=apistra, main="Plot of Growth Categories by School levels"t)
```


\indent Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-25) suggests that the distributions of growth
scores may not be the same across the levels of the
schools with many more high growth *Elementary* schools than in either 
the *Middle* or *High* school groups (the "high" growth category
is labeled as (48, 133] providing the interval of growth scores placed in this
category). Similarly, the proportion of the low or negative growth (category of
(-47.6, 6.75] for "growth" between -47.6 and 6.75) is least frequently occurring in *Elementary*
schools and most frequent in the *High* schools. Statisticians often work
across many disciplines and so may not always have the subject area knowledge
to know why these differences exist (just like you might not), but an education
researcher could take this sort of information -- because it is a useful summary
of interesting school-level data -- and generate further insights into why
growth in the API metric may or may not be a good or fair measure of school
performance. 

\indent Of course, we want to consider whether these results can extend to the 
population of all California schools. The homogeneity hypotheses for 
assessing the growth rate categories across the types of schools would be:

* $H_0$: There is no difference in the distribution of growth categories 
across the three levels of schools in the population of California schools.

* $H_A$: There is some difference in the distribution of growth categories 
across the three levels of schools in the population of California schools. 

\indent There might be an issue with the independence assumption in that schools 
within the same district might
be more similar to one another and different between one another. Sometimes
districts are accounted for in education research to account for differences in
policies and demographics among the districts. We could explore this issue by
finding district-level average growth rates and exploring whether those vary
systematically but this is beyond the scope of the current exploration. 

\indent Checking the expected cell counts gives insight into the assumption for 
using the $\boldsymbol{\chi^2}$-distribution to find the p-value:

##     M       12.5        13   12.25    12.25
```

The smallest expected count is 12.25, occurring in four different cells,
so we can use the parametric approach.

chisq.test(growthtable) 
```

## 
## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test
## 
## data:  growthtable
## X-squared = 38.668, df = 6, p-value = 8.315e-07
```

The observed test statistic is $X^2=38.67$ and, based on a 
$\boldsymbol{\chi^2}(6)$ distribution, the p-value is 0.0000008. This p-value
suggests that there is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference in the distribution of API growth of schools among
*Elementary*, *Middle* and *High School* in the population of schools in 
California between 1999 and 2000, and we can conclude that there is some difference in the population (California
schools). Because the schools were randomly selected from all the California
schools we can make valid inferences to all the schools but because the level of schools, obviously, cannot be randomly
assigned, we cannot say that level of school causes these differences. 

\indent The standardized residuals can enhance this interpretation, displayed in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-26). The *Elementary* schools have fewer low/negative growth schools and more
high growth schools than expected under the null hypothesis. The *High* 
schools have more low growth and fewer higher growth (growth over 25 points) schools 
than expected if there were no difference in patterns of response across 
the school levels. The *Middle* school results were closer to the results 
expected if there were no differences across the school levels.

\indent The binning of quantitative variables is not a first step in analyses --
the quantitative
version is almost always preferable. However, this analysis avoided the
violation of the normality assumption that was somewhat problematic for the
ANOVA and still provided useful inferences to the differences in the types of
schools. When one goes from a quantitative to categorical version of a
variable, one loses information (the specific details of the quantitative
responses within each level created) and this almost always will result in a
loss of statistical power of the procedure.
\index{power}
In this situation, the p-value from
the ANOVA was of the order $10^{-10}$ while the Chi-square test had a
p-value of order $10^{-7}$. This larger p-value is typical of the loss of
power in going to a categorical response when more information was available. 
In many cases, there are no options but to use contingency table analyses. This
example shows that there might be some situations where "going categorical"
could be an acceptable method for handing situations where an assumption is
violated.

## Chapter summary	{#section5-12}

Chi-square tests can be generally used to perform two types of tests,
the Independence and Homogeneity
tests. The appropriate analysis is determined based on the data collection
methodology. The parametric Chi-square distribution for which these tests are
named is appropriate when the expected cell counts are large enough (related to
having a large enough overall sample). When the expected cell count condition is violated, the
permutation approach can provide valuable inferences in these situations in
most situations. 

\indent Data displays of the stacked bar chart (Homogeneity) and mosaic plots 
(Independence) provide a visual
summary of the results that can also be found in contingency tables. You should
have learned how to calculate the $X^2$ (X-squared) test statistic
based on first finding the expected cell counts. Under certain assumptions, it
will follow a Chi-Square distribution with $(R-1)(C-1)$ degrees of freedom. When
those assumptions are not met, it is better to use a permutation approach to
find p-values. Either way, the same statistic is used to test either kind of
hypothesis, independence or homogeneity. After assessing evidence against the null hypothesis, it is interesting to see which cells in the table
contributed to the deviations from the null hypothesis. The standardized
residuals provide that information. Graphing them in a mosaic plot makes for a
fun display to identify the large residuals and often allows you to better
understand the results. This should tie back into the original data display (tableplot, stacked bar chart or mosaic plot) and
contingency table where you identified initial patterns and help to tell the story of the results.

## Practice problems	{#section5-14}


5.1. **Determine type of Chi-Square test** Determine which type of test is appropriate in each situation --
***Independence***  or  ***Homogeneity***?

5.1.1. Concerns over diseases being transmitted between birds and humans 
have led to many areas developing
monitoring plans for the birds that are in their regions. The duck pond on
campus at MSU-Bozeman is a bit like a night club for the birds that pass
through Bozeman. 

i) Suppose that a researcher randomly
samples 20 ducks at the duck pond on campus on 4 different 
occasions and records the number ducks that are healthy and number 
that are sick on each day. The variables in this study are the day of
measurement and sick/healthy. 

ii) In another monitoring study, a researcher goes to a wetland area
and collects a random sample from all birds
present on a single day, classifies them by type of bird (ducks, 
swans, etc.) and then assesses whether each is sick or healthy. 
The variables in this study are type of bird and sick/healthy. 

5.1.2. Psychologists performed an experiment on 48 male bank supervisors 
attending a management institute to investigate biases against women 
in personnel decisions. The supervisors were
asked to make a decision on whether to promote a hypothetical applicant based
on a personnel file. For half of them, the application file described 
a female candidate; for the others it described a male. 

5.1.3. Researchers collected data on death
penalty sentencing in Georgia. For 243 crimes, they categorized the crime by
severity from 1 to 6 with Category 1 comprising barroom brawls, liquor-induced
arguments, lovers' quarrels, and similar crimes and Category 6 including the
most vicious, cruel, cold-blooded, unprovoked crimes. They also recorded the
perpetrator's race. They wanted to know if there was a relationship between
race and type of crime. 

5.1.4. Epidemiologists want to see if
Vitamin C helped people with colds. They would like to give some patients
Vitamin C and some a placebo then compare the two groups. However, they are
worried that the placebo might not be working. Since vitamin C has such a
distinct taste, they are worried the participants will know which group they are
in. To test if the placebo was working, they collected 200 subjects and
randomly assigned half to take a placebo and the other half to take Vitamin C. 
30 minutes later, they asked the subjects which supplement they received
(hoping that the patients would not know which group they were assigned to). 

5.1.5. Is zodiac sign related to GPA?
300 randomly selected students from MSU were asked their birthday and their
current GPA. GPA was then categorized as < 1.50 = F, 1.51-2.50 = D, 
2.51 - 3.25 = C, 3.26-3.75 = B, 3.76-4.0 = A and their birthday was used 
to find their zodiac sign. 

5.1.6. In 1935, the statistician R. A. 
Fisher famously had a colleague claim that she could distinguish whether milk
or tea was added to a cup first. Fisher presented her, in a random order, 4
cups that were filled with milk first and 4 cups that were filled with tea first. 

5.1.7. Researchers wanted to see if
people from Rural and Urban areas aged differently. They contacted 200 people
from Rural areas and 200 people from Urban areas and asked the participants
their age (<40, 41-50, 51-60, >60). 


5.2. **Data is/are analysis** The [FiveThirtyEight Blog](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
often shows up with interesting data summaries
that have general public appeal. Their staff includes a bunch of quants with
various backgrounds. When starting their blog, they had to decide on the data
is/are question that we introduced in Section \@ref(section2-1). To help them 
think about this, they collected a nationally representative sample 
that contained three questions about this. Based on their survey, they 
concluded that 



(ref:fig5-27) Tableplot of data from "data-is-vs-data-are" survey, sorted by "CareAbout" responses. 

![(\#fig:Figure5-27)(ref:fig5-27)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-27-1.pdf) 

> Relevant to the 
 [interests of FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/data-is-vs-data-are/) in particular, we also asked whether people preferred using "data" as a
 singular or plural noun. To those who prefer the plural, I'll put this in
 your terms: The data are pretty conclusive that the vast majority of 
 respondents think we should say "data is. " The singular crowd won by a 58
 percentage-point margin, with 79 percent of respondents liking "data is" to 21
 percent preferring "data are. " But only half of respondents had put any
 thought to the usage prior to our survey, so it seems that it's not a 
 pressing issue for most. 
>

This came from a survey that contained questions about *which is the 
correct usage*, (``isare``), *have you thought about this issue* 
(``thoughtabout``) with levels Yes/No, and *do you care about this issue*
(``careabout``) with four levels from *Not at all* to *A lot*. The following
code loads their data set after missing responses were removed, does a
little re-ordering of factor levels to help make the results easier to 
understand, and makes a tableplot (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-27)) to get a general sense of the results 
including information on the respondents' gender, age, income, and education. 


```r
library(readr)
csd <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/csd.csv")
```



```r
library(tabplot)
#Need to make it explicit that these are factor variables
csd$careabout <- factor(csd$careabout) 
#Reorders factor levels to be in "correct" order
csd$careabout <- factor(csd$careabout,
                    levels=levels(csd$careabout)[c(1,4,3,2)]) 
csd$Education <- factor(csd$Education)
csd$Education <- factor(csd$Education,
                    levels=levels(csd$Education)[c(4,3,5,1,2)])
csd$Household.Income <- factor(csd$Household.Income)
csd$Household.Income <- factor(csd$Household.Income,
                    levels=levels(csd$Household.Income)[c(1,4,5,6,2,3)])
#Sorts plot by careabout responses
tableplot(csd[,c("isare","careabout","thoughtabout","Gender",
                 "Age","Household.Income","Education")], sortCol=careabout,
          pals=list("BrBG"), sample=F) 
```

5.2.1. If we are interested in the variables ``isare`` and ``careabout``,
what sort of test should we perform?

5.2.2. Make the appropriate plot of the results for the table relating 
those two variables relative to your answer to 5.8. 

5.2.3. Generate the contingency table
and find the expected cell counts, first "by hand" and then check them using
the output. Is the parametric procedure appropriate here? Why or why not?

5.2.4. Report the value of the test
statistic, its distribution under the null, the parametric p-value, and write a
decision and conclusion, making sure to address scope of inference. 

5.2.5. Make a mosaic plot with the
standardized residuals and discuss the results. Specifically, in what way do
the is/are preferences move away from the null hypothesis for people that care
more about this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We might be fighting a losing battle on "data is a plural word", 
but since we are in the group that cares a lot about this, we are going to 
keep trying...

![(\#fig:Figure5-28)(ref:fig5-28)](05-chiSquaredTests_files/figure-latex/Figure5-28-1.pdf) 

5.3. **Overtake close calls by outfit analysis** We can revisit the car overtake passing distance data from Chapter \@ref(chapter3) and to focus in on the "close calls". The following code uses the ``ifelse`` function to create the close call/not response variable. It works to create a two-category variable where the first category (*close*) is encountered when the condition is true (``dd$Distance<=100``, so the passing distance was less than or equal to 100 cm) from the "if" part of the function (*if Distance is less than or equal to 100 cm, then "close"*) and the "else" is the second category (when the ``Distance`` was over 100 cm) and gets the category of *notclose*. The ``factor`` function is applied to the results from ``ifelse`` to make this a categorical variable for later use. Some useful code and a stacked bar chart in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5-28) is provided.
